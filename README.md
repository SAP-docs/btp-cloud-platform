# Contributions to the SAP BTP Documentation

Found a mistake in our documentation? Always wanted to change some description or add a step in one of our procedures that could save many others much time? You're then at the right place! All contributions made to the Markdown files in the [docs](docs) directory are reviewed, and if deemed valuable be added to our [official documentation on SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/6a2c1ab5a31b4ed9a2ce17a5329e1dd8.html). The easiest way is to start there, and choose _Edit_ to find the right Markdown file to contribute to.

## Requirements

For contributions, it's required that you have a GitHub account. For more information, see [Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) in the GitHub documentation.


## Contributing

We recommend using the documentation of SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) on SAP Help Portal as a starting point for contributions:

1. Open the [SAP BTP Documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/6a2c1ab5a31b4ed9a2ce17a5329e1dd8.html).
1. You can either:
    * Choose *Feedback* > *Edit page* to suggest a change for the current page you see in the Help Portal viewer, or
    * Choose *Feedback* > *Create issue* to open a GitHub issue in this repository.

    Choosing any of these options allows you start a conversation with us. We can clarify the proposed changes or issues and then update the documentation properly.

If you only make a small contribution, that's the quickest way to propose a change. For larger contributions, we recommend forking this repository to work locally. The filenames in the [docs](docs) directory are created based on the title of the page on SAP Help Portal.
