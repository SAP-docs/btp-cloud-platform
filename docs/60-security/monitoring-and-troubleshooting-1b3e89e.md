# Monitoring and Troubleshooting

This section provides information on troubleshooting-related activities for the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service in the Cloud Foundry environment.



> ### Tip:  
> We also recommend that you regularly check the SAP Notes and Knowledge Base for component `BC-CP-CF-SEC-IAM` in the [SAP Support Portal](https://support.sap.com/home.html). These contain information about program corrections and provide additional information.
> 
> To help you troubleshoot your issue, we also recommend increasing the log verbosity of your application and application router. We provide a [script](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration/tree/master/troubleshooting/logcollector) to help you. If for some reason you can't use this script, increase the log verbosity manually, see related link.
> 
> To troubleshoot problems with tokens from SAP Cloud Identity Services, see [Logging OpenID Connect Tokens](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/b6c42b53518b46de8b4dffd8c4c52ed7.html?version=Cloud) in the documentation for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

Our troubleshooting information can be found in [Troubleshooting for SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service](troubleshooting-for-sap-authorization-and-trust-management-service-c33d777.md). Check the individual troubleshooting topics for your error message. If you can't find your problem, create an incident in the component `BC-CP-CF-SEC-IAM`. For more information, see [Monitoring and Troubleshooting](monitoring-and-troubleshooting-1b3e89e.md).
