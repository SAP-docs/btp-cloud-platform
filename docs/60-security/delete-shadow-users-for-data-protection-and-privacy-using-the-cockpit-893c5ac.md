# Delete Shadow Users for Data Protection and Privacy Using the Cockpit

Data privacy regulations or policies may require you to delete this data, for example, when the user has left your organization. SAP BTP cockpit offers an application to select and delete shadow users.

## Prerequisites

You have the required authorizations.

For more information, see [Security Administration: Managing Authentication and Authorization](../50-administration-and-ops/security-administration-managing-authentication-and-authorization-1ff47b2.md) or [Role Collections and Roles in Global Accounts, Directories, and Subaccounts](../10-concepts/role-collections-and-roles-in-global-accounts-directories-and-subaccounts-0039cf0.md).



## Context

> ### Note:  
> When handling personal data, consider the legislation in the various countries and regions where your organization operates. After the data has passed the end of purpose, regulations might require you to delete the data. For more information on data protection and privacy, see the related link.

The User Account and Authentication service stores user-related data records in the form of shadow users. The UAA uses the information of the shadow users to issue tokens that refer to the specific user. If automatic shadow user creation is enabled, the UAA creates the shadow users when the user authenticates. Otherwise, the UAA creates the shadow user as soon as you assign the user a role collection. These conditions apply to platform users and business users. For more information about shadow users, see the Cloud Foundry documentation.

> ### Note:  
> You can also delete users using the User Management \(SCIM\) API.

## Procedure

1.  Open the SAP BTP cockpit.

2.  Go to your global account, directory, or subaccount \(see [Navigate in the Cockpit](../50-administration-and-ops/navigate-in-the-cockpit-0874895.md)\).

3.  Choose *Security* \> *Users*.

    > ### Note:  
    > For directories, choose *Users*. There is no *Security* menu item.

4.  From the list of users, select the users to delete.

      
      
    **Filter for Users Who Haven't Logged On**

    > ### Recommendation:  
    > Users, who have left your organization, haven't logged on recently. Use the *Hasn't Logged On* filter option to find users who haven't logged on in the last 180 days.
    > 
    > The last logon date you filter for varies from situation to situation. The filter value must meet the following requirements:
    > 
    > -   Be long enough that the filter doesn't catch users who are simply on vacation or don't work regularly in the system.
    > 
    > -   Not be so long that the filter no longer meets your data protection and privacy requirements.
    > 
    > 
    > Think about users on parental leave or on a longer leave of absence, too.

    > ### Caution:  
    > You can't undo the deletion of a user. When you delete a user, you delete any direct assignments of role collections to that user. You also potentially invalidate any application referencing that user.
    > 
    > For example, an application saves some data relating to a user. When you delete the user, that data points to an ID that no longer exists. You can recreate the user, but the new user has a different ID, even though other attributes, such as e-mail, first name, and last name, are identical.

5.  Delete the selected users.
