# Kyma Security Concepts

SAP BTP, Kyma runtime takes various security measures regarding your cluster and its underlying infrastructure. Benefit from the security setup that SAP BTP, Kyma runtime provides.

## Cloud Infrastructure

All components required to run Kyma, namely Gardener, Kyma Control Plane, and a Kyma cluster, are deployed on SAP-managed IaaS provider accounts. SAP has strict guidelines to secure IaaS provider accounts and the resources deployed into them. The secure configuration is monitored regularly, and the following preventive controls are in place to revert critical configurations that weaken the security of the IaaS provider account:



### Authentication

-   A strict password policy is in place.

-   Multi-factor authentication is enabled.




### Authorization

-   Permissions are assigned based on role-based access control \(RBAC\).

-   The principle of least privilege is followed.




### Storage

-   Storage services are not publicly accessible.

-   Encryption using Advanced Encryption Standard \(AES\) with a key length of at least 256 is used.

## Kubernetes Control Plane

Kyma uses Gardener as its managed Kubernetes offering. With Gardener, the control plane of a Kubernetes cluster is hosted as a set of Pods in the Gardener environment. See the overview of the [Gardener architecture](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/concepts/architecture/#overview-architecture-diagram). In order to harden the Kubernetes control plane as well as the Kubernetes components on the worker nodes, Gardener sets up the cluster in accordance with the Defense Information Systems Agency \(DISA\) Security Technical Implementation Guides \(STIGs\) requirements \([V1R6](https://cyber.trackr.live/stig/Kubernetes/1/6)\).

The Kubernetes control plane fulfills the following DISA STIGs requirements:

<a name="loiodbf4503053634acfa4465e0c6d25437f__section_uwp_pvd_rzb"/>

## Network Separation



### Namespaces

Kyma components are deployed into the `kyma-system` and the `istio-system` namespaces. The default namespace is not used.



### Network Policies

You, the customer, have full access to the cluster and can establish appropriate network policies to restrict network traffic. Because Istio is a default Kyma module, the customer can also establish PeerAuthentication policies to control the network traffic.



### Encryption

All communication in the Kyma cluster is encrypted using TLS 1.2.



<a name="loiodbf4503053634acfa4465e0c6d25437f__section_hfc_lwd_rzb"/>

## Authentication and Authorization



### Authentication at the API Server

By default, a SAP BTP, Kyma runtime cluster is deployed with a shared tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services provided by SAP. This Identity Provider \(IDP\) uses OIDC tokens to authenticate and is configured to enforce multi-factor authentication.

As a best practice, you, the customer, can change the IdP to one controlled by you. This gives you control over the identity lifecycle of your accounts. Learn how to [Configuring a Custom Identity Provider for Kyma](configuring-a-custom-identity-provider-for-kyma-67bcc6e.md).

The Kubernetes API Server fulfills the following DISA STIGs requirements:

-   Anonymous authentication is disabled \(V-242390\).

-   Basic authentication is disabled to protect information in transit \(V-245542\).

-   Token authentication is disabled to protect information in transit \(V-245543\).




### Role-based Access Control

RBAC is enabled on Kyma clusters. The Roles and ClusterRoles deployed by Kyma follow the principle of least privilege.

Following DISA STIGs requirements, the Kubernetes API server enables RBAC as the authorization mode \(V-242382\).



<a name="loiodbf4503053634acfa4465e0c6d25437f__section_sd2_fph_rzb"/>

## High Availability

Kyma worker nodes are distributed over several availability zones in order to prevent outages of the cloud providersâ€™ availability zones.

## Logging



### Kubernetes-Native Audit Logging Configuration

Audit Logging of the Kubernetes API server is active, and the logs are written to SAP Platform Logging Service for SAP BTP.

The Kubernetes API server fulfils the following DISA STIGs requirements:

-   An audit policy \(V-242401\), an audit log path \(V-242402, V-242465\), and audit log retention \(V-242464\) are set.

-   Audit records that provide information about the type of event that has occurred, the source of the event, the results of the event, any users and containers associated with the event are generated \(V-242403\).

-   Audit logs are enabled \(V-242461\).

-   Audit log maximum size \(V-242462\), and maximum backup are configured \(V-242463\).




### Container Logging

Kyma modules ship logs that contain information relevant to the containers.
