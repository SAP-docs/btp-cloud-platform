## Security Events of the SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service

The SAP Authorization and Trust Management service uses role collections to handle account management.

SAP Authorization and Trust Management service records all its changes in its database tables and summarizes these changes in the audit log. The following table summarizes the audit log entries.

> ### Note:  
> ***UNKNOWN\_USER*** in an audit log message is a placeholder, which usually appears when logs are written for flows that don't involve users, for example, client credential flows.

For more information, see [Include Tokens from Corporate Identity Providers or SAP Cloud Identity Services in Tokens of the SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service](../30-development/include-tokens-from-corporate-identity-providers-or-sap-cloud-identity-services-in-tokens-8dc480a.md).

However, keep in mind that even the retry might not yield the desired token, so ensure your application can handle this situation appropriately.

Occurs when the time skew between SAP Authorization and Trust Management service and the identity provider is larger than 60 seconds. Or the authentication response took more than 60 seconds to reach the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service after being issued.
