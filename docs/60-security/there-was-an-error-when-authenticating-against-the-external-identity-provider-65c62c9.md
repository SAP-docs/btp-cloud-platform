# There Was an Error When Authenticating Against the External Identity Provider



<a name="loio65c62c9b10ec468983e6cc007a8717ff__section_abs_b3h_hgc"/>

## Symptom

You have configured a custom identity provider for applications in the SAP BTP cockpit, such as the SAP Cloud Identity Services.

When you open an SAP BTP application, such as a custom developed application or a subscribed application like SAP Business Application Studio, you receive the following error:

***There was an error when authenticating against the external identity provider: The user account must be pre-created. Please contact your system administrator.***

## Reason and Prerequisites

The user from the custom identy provider for applications doesn't exist in the list of users of the SAP BTP cockpit.

When a user authenticates at an application in your subaccount using any identity provider, the User Account and Authentication always stores user-related data provided by the identity provider in the form of shadow users. It uses details of the shadow users to issue tokens that refer to a specific user.

By default, the User Account and Authentication allows any user of any connected identity provider to authenticate to applications in the subaccount. When thereâ€™s no corresponding shadow user, it automatically creates one based on the information received from the identity provider.

However if *Create Shadow Users on User Logon* is turned off, shadow users aren't created, which causes the issue.

## Solution

To resolve the issue, use one of the following options:

-   Enable *Create Shadow Users on User Logon* for the custom identity provider in the SAP BTP cockpit:

    1.  In the SAP BTP cockpit, go to your subaccount \(see [Navigate in the Cockpit](../50-administration-and-ops/navigate-in-the-cockpit-0874895.md)\) and choose *Security* \> *Trust Configuration*.

    2.  Select your custom identity provider for applications.

    3.  Choose *Edit*.

    4.  Activate *Create Shadow Users During Logon*.

    5.  Choose *Save*.


-   Manually create a user for yor the respective identity provider in the SAP BTP cockpit \(see [Create Users](../50-administration-and-ops/create-users-a3bc7e8.md)\).

    1.  In the SAP BTP cockpit, go to your subaccount \(see [Navigate in the Cockpit](../50-administration-and-ops/navigate-in-the-cockpit-0874895.md)\) and choose *Security* \> *Users*.

    2.  Create a new user for the respective identity provider by using *Create*.


-   Use the SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Provisioning to import users from a source system to the respective subaccount. Follow the instructions in [SAP BTP XS Advanced UAA \(Cloud Foundry\)](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-provisioning/identity-provisioning/target-sap-btp-xs-advanced-uaa-cloud-foundry).


> ### Note:  
> After creating the users in the subaccount, add the relevant role collection for users. The users must have the authorization to access the application \(see [Assign Users to Role Collections](../50-administration-and-ops/assign-users-to-role-collections-c576676.md)\).
