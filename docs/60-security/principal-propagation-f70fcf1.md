**Other Principal Propagation Scenarios**

-   [On-Premise User Store](https://help.sap.com/viewer/ea72206b834e4ace9cd834feed6c0e09/Cloud/en-US/04cbd0f30d524612aa438ed0b0eed217.html "If you already have an existing on-premise system with a populated user store, you can configure SAP BTP applications to use that on-premise user store. This approach is similar to implementing identity federation with a corporate identity provider. In that way, applications do not need to keep the whole user database, but request the necessary information from the on-premise system.") :arrow_upper_right:
