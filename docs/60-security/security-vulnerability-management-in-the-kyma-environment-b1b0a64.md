# Security Vulnerability Management in the Kyma Environment

SAP employs a vulnerability management process to ensure the security of SAP BTP, Kyma runtime. Within this process, we identify, assess, prioritize, remedy, and monitor vulnerabilities. We also provide hotfixes between regular releases for critical vulnerabilities our security organization identifies.

Kyma development teams regularly scan SAP-owned code and the container images that are part of SAP BTP, Kyma runtime, Kyma Control Plane, and Kyma dashboard for known and potential vulnerabilities. The security scanning technologies in use are:

-   Static Application Security Testing \(SAST\) for the proprietary code
-   Open Source Vulnerability Management \(OSVM\) for open-source software that is part of Kyma runtime

> ### Note:  
> SAP ensures security scans for Kyma runtime, and you, as a customer, are responsible for scanning your own workloads added to the Kyma cluster. For details, read [Operating Model in the Kyma Environment.](../70-getting-support/operating-model-in-the-kyma-environment-862b96b.md)

The scanning results are constantly monitored and addressed without undue delay. New vulnerabilities are assigned to responsible development teams for remediation. If an update is available, the vulnerability is fixed. If not, the vulnerability is subject to further analysis to identify its associated risk and implement appropriate measures. For critical vulnerabilities identified by SAP's security organization, hotfixes are provided between regular releases.

> ### Remember:  
> Kyma development teams analyze each vulnerability to assess its actual severity in the Kyma environment. Therefore, the severity score may be lowered or identified as false-positive.
