# Share Authorization and Trust Management service instances



## Symptom

You want to share Authorization and Trust Management service instances among different Cloud Foundry spaces or environments.



## Reason and Prerequisites

-   You use an Authorization and Trust Management service instance of the *application* type.
-   You want to use the service instance in multiple spaces or environments, without recreating it multiple times.



## Solution

Use the SAP BTP command line interface \(btp CLI\) to share the *application* plan.
