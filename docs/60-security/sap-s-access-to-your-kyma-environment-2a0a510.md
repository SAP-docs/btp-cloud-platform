# SAP's Access to Your Kyma Environment

SAP BTP, Kyma runtime provides reliable, secure infrastructure management while ensuring you maintain full control over your applications.

As a managed service, SAP BTP, Kyma runtime maintains a clear separation of responsibilities: SAP acts as the platform operator, and customers as the application owners. Customers retain full control over their applications and workloads, while SAP manages the underlying infrastructure, to ensure continuous platform stability. For more information, see [Operating Model in the Kyma Environment](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/operating-model-in-kyma-environment?version=Cloud). This model requires SAP to occasionally access your cluster for operational purposes.

SAP can access your environment exclusively for the following operational tasks:

-   Maintenance activities: routine system upkeep and optimization

-   Upgrades: platform version updates and feature deployments

-   Patching: security fixes and vulnerability remediation

-   Troubleshooting: investigation and resolution of platform-level issues


Access is carefully controlled, time-limited, and fully auditable to maintain security and compliance standards. These standards are outlined by the International Organization for Standardization \(ISO\), the Security Operations Center \(SOC\), and the General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\).
