# Updating an ABAP System

Learn how to update your ABAP environment instance.



## Context

> ### Note:  
> After you have created an ABAP environment instance, you can only change the ABAP system description and ABAP runtime size.
> 
> To change the initial admin, you have to use the *Maintain Employees* SAP Fiori app. See [Maintain Employees](../50-administration-and-ops/maintain-employees-e882b0f.md).



## Procedure

1.  In the SAP BTP cockpit, choose your Cloud Foundry subaccount and navigate to the space, in which you have created your ABAP environment instance. See [Navigate in the Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/products/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/0874895f1f78459f9517da55a11ffebd.html).

2.  From the navigation area, choose *Services* \> *Instances and Subscriptions*.

    You see a list of all instances that have been created.

3.  Select your *ABAP environment* instance and choose *Update* by clicking on <span class="SAP-icons"></span> at the end of the row.

4.  In the *Update Instance* wizard, you can update the description of your ABAP environment instance and the size of the ABAP runtime. See [Increasing the Quota for the ABAP Environment](increasing-the-quota-for-the-abap-environment-c40cb18.md).

5.  Choose *Update Instance* to save your changes.
