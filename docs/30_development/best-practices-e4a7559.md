# Best Practices

To help you create concise and comprehensible models with CDS, we have put together a list of best practices.

-   [Domain Modeling](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/domain-models) - Find here an introduction to the basics of domain modeling with CDS, complemented with recommended best practices.

-   [Providing Services](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/providing-services) - Learn in this guide how to define services exposed through REST and OData APIs, including an overview of generic features to serve metadata as well as most CRUD requests out of the box, input validations and more.

-   [Consuming Services](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/consuming-services) - CAP provides manifold generic handlers for common, recurring tasks, which serve many requests out-of-the-box, thereby capturing proven best practices collected from a wealth of successful SAP applications.

-   [Using Databases](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/databases) - This guide is about defining, providing, implementing, deploying, and publishing services — so about Service Providers in general.

-   [Localization](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/i18n) - Guides you through the steps to internationalize your application to provide localized versions with respect to both Localized Models as well as Localized Data.

-   [Localized Data](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/localized-data) - Guides you through the steps to internationalize your application to provide localized versions.

-   [Temporal Data](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/temporal-data) - Temporal data allow maintaining information relating to past, present, and future application time.

-   [Authorization](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/authorization) - About restricting access to data by adding respective declarations to CDS models, which are then enforced in service implementations.

-   [SaaS Extensibility](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/extensibility) - How SaaS subscribers can extend SaaS applications on a tenant level.

-   [Multitenancy](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/multitenancy) - How to implement multitenant aware applications \(SaaS applications\) with CAP.
