## Key Features

You can use this app to:



-   Display a list of all already existing trusted certificates

-   Upload a new certificate

-   Display detailed information

-   Check for updates of certificate trusts and adopt the changes if required

    > ### Note:  
    > SAP delivers its systems with pre-defined trusted certificates. If the trusted certificates change at a later point in time, there are no automatic updates. We therefore recommend that you use the *Check for Updates* function on a regular basis and adopt any changes to certificate trusts that you require.

-   Delete trusted certificates from the list. This feature is enabled only for the certificate type *Managed By Customer*. Certificates of the type *Managed By SAP* cannot be deleted and therefore the *Delete* button is disabled.
