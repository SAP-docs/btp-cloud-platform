## Overview

> ### Note:  
> The SAP SuccessFactors Extensibility service is also availÐ°ble for global accounts marked with EU Access. See [Regions](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/regions).

SAP BTP offers a standard way for extending SAP solutions.

You can extend SAP SuccessFactors systems without disrupting the performance and the core processes. When building extension applications, you can also benefit from the automation of the integration between the cloud platform and SAP SuccessFactors.

## Process Flow

To integrate SAP BTP and SAP SuccessFactors so that you can build extension applications, you need to perform the following tasks:

1. Connect the SAP SuccessFactors system that you want to extend with the corresponding global account in SAP BTP.

During the pairing process you create a registration token which is then used by the SAP SuccessFactors system tenant administrator to configure the integration on the SAP SuccessFactors system side.

> ### Note:  
> You cannot migrate the registered SAP SuccessFactors systems between global accounts.
> 
> If you want to start using another global account, you will have to register your SAP SuccessFactors systems again.

2. Make the SAP SuccessFactors system accessible in the subaccounts in which you want to build your extension applications.

To do so, you configure the entitlements and assign the corresponding quota where the extension applications will reside.

3. Configure the communication flow.

To do so, create a service instance of the SAP SuccessFactors Extensibility service using the *api-access* service plan.

During the service instance creation an HTTP destination on a subaccount level is automatically generated in this subaccount. It contains all instance binding properties which are sufficient to establish connection to the SAP SuccessFactors system.

SAP BTP supports the following authentication scenarios for SAP SuccessFactors:

-   OData access with OAuth 2.0 SAML bearer assertion

-   OData access with OAuth 2.0 SAML bearer assertion with technical user

4. Configure the Single-Sign On \(SSO\) between the subaccount in SAP BTP and the SAP SuccessFactors system.

To ensure the required security for accessing the applications, you need to configure the single sign-on between the subaccount in SAP BTP and the SAP SuccessFactors system using a SAML identity provider.

5. If you have performed an automated instance refresh or your cloud operators have performed a manual instance refresh, you need to restore some of the extension configuration settings.
