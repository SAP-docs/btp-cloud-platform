## Personalize the Systems Page



### Configure Columns

In the *Systems* page, there are a lot of columns including details of each system. In your daily work you may not need all the information in these columns. You can decide which information is important to you and leave out only the columns that you need in the order that you want.

In the SAP BTP cockpit, on a global account level, go to *System Landscape* \> *Systems*. Choose :gear: and then choose the *Columns* tab. You can hide all the columns except the *System Name* column. You can also rearrange the columns to appear in the order you want.



### Sort, Filter, and Group Systems

If you have a lot of systems in the *Systems* page, you need an easy way to work with them. You can sort, filter, and group systems by different criteria depending on your use case.

In the SAP BTP cockpit, on a global account level, go to *System Landscape* \> *Systems*. Choose :gear: and then choose the *Sort*, *Filter*, or *Group* tab and define the criteria you want to apply.

> ### Note:  
> By default you have only 50 systems visible in the *Systems* list. Before sorting, filtering or grouping systems, make sure you've loaded all the systems on the screen. You can do that by choosing *More* at the bottom of the *Systems* list until all the systems are visible on the screen.

## Personalize the Formations Page



### Configure Systems in Formations

When working with formations, you can adjust the columns of the systems included in a formation. You can hide and rearrange columns for the systems in the same way as in the *Systems* page, or differently. You adjust the columns for the systems in all the formations at once and not per formation.

In the SAP BTP cockpit, on a global account level, go to *System Landscape* \> *Formations*. Choose :gear: and then choose the *Columns* tab. You can hide all the columns except the *System Name* column. You can also rearrange the columns to appear in the order you want.

You can also sort, and group the systems included in the formations.



### Search for Formations

If you have a lot of formations in the *Formations* page, you need an easy way to find them.

In the SAP BTP cockpit, on a global account level, go to *System Landscape* \> *Formations*. Choose :mag: and enter the keywords you expect to have in the formation name or in the formation type.
