# Approve or Reject a Consent Request



## Context

You approve or reject consent for a system in one of the following cases:

-   As an SAP partner, you develop multitenant applications, deploy them to SAP BTP and sell subscriptions to your customers. When customers have subscribed to your application, they may want to request a consent from you so they have a respective system in their *Systems* page in their global accounts.

-   As a system administrator giving additional authorizations so the system can be included in a formation.

To learn more about the use cases of consent requests of systems, see [Requesting Consent for a System](requesting-consent-for-a-system-091bc08.md).



## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the SAP BTP cockpit and navigate to *System Landscape* \> *Consent Requests*.

2.  In the *Incoming Consent Requests* tab, choose *Approve* or *Reject* for each request.
