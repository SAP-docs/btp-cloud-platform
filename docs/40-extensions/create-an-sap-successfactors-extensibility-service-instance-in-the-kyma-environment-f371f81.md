# Create an SAP SuccessFactors Extensibility Service Instance in the Kyma Environment



<a name="loiof371f81d06c64a0fb507307c9ad24646__prereq_fms_2dv_5lb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   Before creating an SAP SuccessFactors Extensibility service instance in the Kyma environment, see [Create a Service Instance to Consume the SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite OData API](create-a-service-instance-to-consume-the-sap-successfactors-hxm-suite-odata-api-46c5ea1.md).

-   Have the Kyma environment enabled for the subaccount you are using. See [Create a Kyma Instance](../50-administration-and-ops/create-a-kyma-instance-09dd313.md).

-   Configure the roles in the Kyma environment. See [Assign Roles in the Kyma Environment](../60-security/assign-roles-in-the-kyma-environment-148ae38.md).

-   The SAP BTP Operator module is enabled. See [Add and Delete a Kyma Module](../50-administration-and-ops/add-and-delete-a-kyma-module-1b548e9.md#loio1b548e9ad4744b978b8b595288b0cb5c)

-   Have the entitlements of the SAP SuccessFactors Extensibility service configured. See [Configure the Entitlements for the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensibility Service](configure-the-entitlements-for-the-sap-s-4hana-cloud-extensibility-service-65ad330.md).




## Context

During the creation of the service instance, a destination on the subaccount level with the same name as the service instance name is automatically created in this subaccount. It contains all instance binding properties which are sufficient to establish connection to the SAP SuccessFactors system.

> ### Note:  
> Make sure that you don't already have a destination with the same name as the service instance. If you do, you will not be able to create the service instance.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the subaccount for which you want to create an SAP SuccessFactors Extensibility service instance.

2.  On the subaccount *Overview* page, in the *Kyma Environment* section, open the Kyma dashboard.

3.  Choose *Namespaces* from the left-hand side navigation and open the namespace in which you want to create a service instance.

4.  Choose *Service Management* \> *Service Instances* from the left-hand side navigation.

5.  In the *Service Instances* page, choose *Create Service Instance* in the upper right-hand corner. A new dialog opens.

6.  Choose the *Advanced* tab and fill in the following fields:

    -   Give a meaningful name of the new SAP SuccessFactors Extensibility service instance.

    -   In the *Offering Name* field, enter `sap-successfactors-extensibility`, which is the technical name of the SAP SuccessFactors Extensibility service.

    -   In the *Plan Name* field, enter `api-access`.

    -   Expand *Instance Parameters*.

        To define the authentication type for the API access, specify the parameters listed in this JSON file: [API Access Configuration JSON File](api-access-configuration-json-file-543fbd6.md).


7.  Choose *Create*.

## Next Steps

After creating the *SAP SuccessFactors Extensibility* service instance, you have to bind the instance to an application, and it will be assigned an access URL and credentials to the corresponding API. See [Using SAP BTP Services in the Kyma Environment](../30-development/using-sap-btp-services-in-the-kyma-environment-ea4dd81.md).
