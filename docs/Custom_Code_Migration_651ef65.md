# Custom Code Migration



## Purpose

The `Custom Code Migration` app enables you to create three different kinds of projects:

1.  SAP S/4HANA Migration Project:

    Analyze custom code that shall be migrated from an existing product like SAP Business Suite to a new product such as SAP S/4HANA 2020. To evaluate the custom objects to be adapted, it performs the SAP S/4HANA custom code checks.

2.  SAP BTP Analysis Project:

    Analyze custom code for readiness to run in SAP BTP, ABAP environment.

3.  Custom Code Analysis Project:

    Analyze custom code with arbitrary ATC check variants.


In addition, this app supports you with identifying unused custom code based on your collected usage data. This enables you to remove unused custom code during a system conversion to SAP S/4HANA.
