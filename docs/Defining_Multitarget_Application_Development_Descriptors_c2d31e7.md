# Defining Multitarget Application Development Descriptors

Multitarget Applications are defined in a development descriptor required for design-time purposes.

The development descriptor \(`mta.yaml`\) defines the elements and dependencies of a Multitarget Application \(MTA\) compliant with the Cloud Foundry environment.

> ### Note:  
> The MTA development descriptor \(`mta.yaml`\) is used to generate the deployment descriptor \(`mtad.yaml`\), which is required for deploying an MTA to the target runtime. If you use command-line tools to deploy an MTA, you do not need an `mta.yaml` file. However, in these cases you have to manually create the `mtad.yaml` file.
