# Creating a Communication Scenario for Unrestriced Access \(Developer\)

In ABAP Development Tools, you can define communication scenarios, which can be used to access business services using a technical communication user.



## Context

In ABAP Development Tools, you define a communication scenario and add the required services to the scenario. An administrator can then use this communication scenario and create a communication arrangement based on it. This communication arrangement is the basis for accessing the business service using a communication user. If you don't include an authorization object to the communication scenario, the communication user will have unrestricted access to the business service.

For more information, see the information about consuming services in the context of APIs in the [user guide for ABAP development tools](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-development-tools-user-guide) \(ADT\).
