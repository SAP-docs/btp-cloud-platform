# Define Specific Properties for Communication Scenarios

For some use cases, such as logical receiver determination based on arbitrary parameters, a communication scenario may require additional parameters that are not part of the standard fields of a communication scenario. Therefore, you can define additional properties in a communication scenario that can be maintained by the administrator in the *Communication Arrangements* app. These properties also support secure storage of data, such as passwords or API keys.
