## Prerequisites

-   You have installed and set up Visual Studio Code including the SAP Fiori tools extensions. See [Visual Studio Code](https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/17efa217f7f34a9eba53d7b209ca4280.html).
-   You have access to a RAP business service that has been exposed as an OData UI service. See [Using Service Binding Editor for OData V2 Service](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-abap-cds-development-user-guide/using-service-binding-editor-for-odata-v2-service?version=Cloud).
-   To establish a connection with your ABAP environment system, you either have to be a space developer in the ABAP environment instance or have access to a service key in the ABAP environment instance. See [Add Space Members Using the Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/add-space-members-using-cockpit?version=Cloud) and [Creating Service Keys](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/creating-service-keys?version=Cloud) in the ABAP service instance.
-   You have established trust by setting up a custom Identity service. See [Setup of a Custom Identity Service](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/setup-of-custom-identity-service?version=Cloud).

## 1. Generating and Deploying Your Application

> ### Note:  
> **Prerequisites** 
> 
> -   You have created a development package in ABAP development tools for Eclipse. See [Creating ABAP Packages](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-abap-development-user-guide/creating-abap-packages?version=Cloud).
> -   You have exposed a RAP business service as an OData UI service. See [Using Service Binding Editor for OData V2 Service](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-abap-cds-development-user-guide/using-service-binding-editor-for-odata-v2-service?version=Cloud).
> -   Business catalog `SAP_A4C_BC_DEV_UID_PC` is assigned to your user, which allows you to discover available OData UI services and deploy your application.
> -   Business catalog `SAP_CORE_BC_EXT_TST` is assigned to your user, which allows you to preview your application. See [Business Catalogs for Development Tasks](../50-administration-and-ops/business-catalogs-for-development-tasks-a9f4278.md).
> -   You have an open transport request.

1.  As a developer user in Visual Studio Code, generate an SAP Fiori application. See [Generate an Application](https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/db44d45051794d778f1dd50def0fa267.html).

    In the *Data Source and Service Selection* section of the Template Wizard, select the following values:

    -   Data source: *Connect to a System*.
    -   System: *New System*
    -   System type: *ABAP Environment on SAP Business Technology Platform*
    -   ABAP environment definition source:
        -   \(Option 1\) **Discover a Cloud Foundry Service** 

            > ### Note:  
            > You have to log on to your Cloud Foundry space by executing command `cf login` in the terminal or by navigating to *View* \> *Find Command* \> *CF: Login to Cloud Foundry*. When you're prompted to enter the API endpoint, org name, and space, you can navigate to your subaccount in the SAP BTP cockpit, where you can find this information.

        -   \(Option 2\) **Upload a Service Key File**

    -   Continue with choosing a system name and service.

    In the *Project Attributes* section, add deployment configuration and FLP configuration to your UI project. See [Additional Configuration](https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/9bea64e63b824261932d90037ce3c5ae.html).

    If you want to create your deployment configuration later, see [Generate Deployment Configuration ABAP](https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/c06b9cbb3f3641aabfe3a5d199e855a0.html).

    If you want to create you FLP configuration later, see [SAP Fiori Launchpad Configuration](https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/bc3cb890dbb84d51ae80394821ce4990.html).

2.  Continue with the development of the UI, for example, with the help of guided development. See [Implement Features using Guided Development](https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/0c9e518ecf704b2f80a2bed0eaca60ae.html).
3.  Now you can preview the generated SAP Fiori application. See [Preview an Application](https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/b962685bdf9246f6bced1d1cc1d9ba1c.html).
4.  Deploy the SAP Fiori UI by executing command `npm run deploy` in the terminal of your project. See [Deployment to ABAP](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/607014e278d941fda4440f92f4a324a6.html#deployment-to-abap).
5.  On top of these launchpad app descriptor items that are created automatically during app deployment, you may also create such objects manually in ABAP development tools for Eclipse. Refer to [Creating Launchpad App Descriptor Items](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-development-tools-user-guide/creating-launchpad-app-descriptor-items).

## 2. Creating and Publishing Your Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) App

> ### Note:  
> **Prerequisites**: Business catalog `SAP_A4C_BC_DEV_PC` is assigned to your user, which is required for development with ABAP development tools for Eclipse. See [Business Catalogs for Development Tasks](../50-administration-and-ops/business-catalogs-for-development-tasks-a9f4278.md).

![](images/DevelopSAPFioriPic1_19a2ef5.png)

1.  To manage access to your SAP Fiori application, you have to log on as a developer in ABAP development tools for Eclipse to create an Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) application, assign a launchpad app descriptor item for your UI5 application and a service, and maintain authorizations \(steps 1-3 in the figure above\). See [Creating an IAM App for the Business Service](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/creating-iam-app-for-business-service?version=Cloud).
2.  Once you have created your IAM app, you have to create a business catalog. See [Creating a Business Catalog](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/iam-creating-business-catalog?version=Cloud).
3.  Assign your IAM app to the business catalog.
4.  Publish the IAM app and business catalog locally.
