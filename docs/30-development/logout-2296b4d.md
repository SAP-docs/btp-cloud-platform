# logout

You can define a central logout end point for your application.



In this object you can define an application's central logout end point by using the `logoutEndpoint` property. The value of logout property should be an object with the following properties:

This is an example:

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> "logout" {
>   "logoutEndpoint": "/my/logout"
> }
> ```

Making a `GET` or `POST` request to “`/my/logout`” triggers a client-initiated central logout with the following consequences:

-   Deletes the user session
-   Requests the logout paths for all your back-end services \(if you provided these paths in the `destinations` and `service` properties\).
-   Redirects to the authentication service \(UAA or Indentity Authentication - depending on which service you are using for the authentication\), if such a service is provided, and logs out from there.

You can use the `logoutPage` property to specify the Web page in one of the following ways:

-   URL path

    The authentication service \(UAA or Indentity Authentication - depending on which service you are using for the authentication\) redirects the user back to the application router, and the path is interpreted according to the configured routes.

    The `logoutEndpoint` can be called with the `skip-redirect` or `skip-redirect=true` query parameter to prevent the application router from redirecting to the Identity Authentication service \(IAS\) for logout after ending the application router user session. Use this configuration if the logout process is initiated by Identity Authentication . In this case, the end user initiates the single logout flow of Identity Authentication, and subsequently, the application router logout endpoint is called. The application router logout endpoint must not redirect to the Identity Authentication logout endpoint in this case. For more details see [Handle Single Logout Request from Identity Authentication](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/configure-your-application-for-single-logout?version=Cloud). For example:

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ```
    > window.location.replace('/my/logout?skip-redirect')
    > ```

    The `logoutEndpoint` can be called with query parameters. For example:

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ```
    > window.location.replace('/my/logout?siteId=3');
    > ```

    These parameters will be appended as is to the redirect URL set by the `logoutPage` property. For example, if the logout section is:

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ```
    > "logout": {
    >     "logoutEndpoint": "/logout",
    >     "logoutPage": "/logoff.html"
    >   },
    > ```

    The redirect URL will end with:

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ```
    > /logoff.html?siteId=3
    > ```

    > ### Note:  
    > The resource that matches the URL path specified in the property `logoutPage` should not require authentication; for this route, the property `authenticationType` must be set to `none`.

    In the following example, `my-static-resources` is a folder in the working directory of the application router; the folder contains the file `logout-page.html` along with other static resources.

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ```
    > { 
    >   "authenticationMethod": "route", 
    >   "logout": { 
    >     "logoutEndpoint": "/my/logout", 
    >     "logoutPage": "/logout-page.html"
    >   }, 
    >   "routes": [ 
    >     {
    >       "source": "^/logout-page.html$", 
    >       "localDir": "my-static-resources", 
    >       "authenticationType": "none"
    >     }
    >   ]
    > } 
    > ```

-   Absolute HTTP\(S\) path

    The authentication service \(UAA or Indentity Authentication - depending on which service you are using for the authentication\) redirects the user to a page \(or application\) different from the application router.

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ```
    > "logout": {
    >   "logoutEndpoint": "/my/logout",
    >   "logoutPage": "http://acme.com/employees.portal" 
    > } 
    > ```

## Using the POST Method for Logout

For security reasons, it is recommended to use *POST* method for logout and to enable CSRF protection.

The `logoutMethod` and `csrfProtection` properties are included in the logout property:

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
>  "logout": {
>     "logoutEndpoint": "/my/logout",
>     "logoutPage": "/logout-page.html",
>     "logoutMethod": "POST",
>     "csrfProtection": true
> }
> ```

> ### Note:  
> For backward compatibility reasons, the default value of `logoutMethod` is `GET`. The `csrfProtection` property can only be set if the `logoutMethod` is `POST`. If the`logoutMethod` is `POST` and the `csrfProtection` property is not set, the `csrfProtection` is enabled by default.

In this example, the `POST` request is an AJAX request and includes a CSRF token:

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> async function getToken() {
>   return new Promise((resolve) => {
>   jQuery.ajax({
>     type: "GET",
>     url: 'my/logout',
>     headers: {
>       "X-CSRF-Token": 'fetch',
>       contentType: "application/json",
>     },
>     success: function(data, textStatus, request){
>       resolve(request.getResponseHeader('X-CSRF-Token'));
>     },
>    });
>  });
> };
> ```

This is an example for the `POST` request:

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> const token = await getToken();
> jQuery.ajax({
>   type: "POST",
>   url: "my/logout",
>   headers: {
>     "X-CSRF-Token": token,
>     contentType: "application/json",
>   },
>   success: function (data) {
>     window.location.href = data;
>   }
> });
> ```

> ### Note:  
> Make sure that the `url` field matches the `logoutEndpoint`.
