# Creating a Job Catalog Entry and a Job Template

Follow these steps to run your business coding in an application job.



## Procedure

1.  Implement the business logic. You need to create a class which implements certain interfaces so that it's usable in an application job. Implement the coding there that should run within the application job. For more information, see [Implementing the Business Logic](implementing-the-business-logic-99dcde1.md).

2.  Define the job catalog entry. Using ABAP development tools for Eclipse, you create a job catalog entry which refers to the class of step 1. In the job catalog entry, you can specify how the selection fields are rendered in the job scheduling dialog in the app. In addition, you can configure various settings which are used by the application job. For more information, see [Creating the Job Catalog Entry](creating-the-job-catalog-entry-1cff59e.md).

3.  Define the job template. Using ABAP development tools for Eclipse, you create a job template which refers to the job catalog entry of step 2. In the job template, you define the default values of the job parameters which appear on the selection screen. For more information, see [Creating the Job Template](creating-the-job-template-1f04ad2.md).

    For more information on how to create a job catalog entry and a job template in ABAP development tools for Eclipse, see [Working with Application Job Objects](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-development-tools-user-guide/working-with-application-job-objects?version=sap_btp).

    If you want to implement a simple RAP \(ABAP RESTful application programming model\) business object, see [Code Sample: How to Schedule Application Jobs from a RAP-based Business Object](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-application-jobs). This code sample allows you to schedule a class as an application job that takes the semantic key of the selected entity as a parameter.
