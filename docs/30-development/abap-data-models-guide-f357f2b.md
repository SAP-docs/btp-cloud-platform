# ABAP Data Models Guide



In the ABAP Cloud development model, data models used for ABAP applications are based on ABAP Core Data Services \(ABAP CDS\). ABAP CDS is used for defining and consuming semantically-rich data models optimized for SAP HANA. ABAP data models can be used as the foundation for analytical and transactional ABAP applications, as well as enterprise search models. The [ABAP Data Models Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-data-models/abap-data-models?locale=en-US) provides information on the different aspects of ABAP data models and their components.
