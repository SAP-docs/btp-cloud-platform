# Integration and Connectivity Development Guide

Get an overview of the ABAP integration and connectivity development guide.



ABAP integration and connectivity allows different systems and applications to communicate and work together. In the context of the ABAP environment, this means enabling ABAP applications to exchange data and functionality with other ABAP and non-ABAP systems. Key technologies make this possible, such as APIs, events, web services, and various communication protocols. The goal is to create an integrated IT landscape where applications can seamlessly share information and processes.

These technologies are described in detail with corresponding examples in the [ABAP integration and connectivity](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-integration-connectivity/abap-integration-and-connectivity) development guide.
