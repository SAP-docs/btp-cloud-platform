## Authorization Trace

There’s an app for troubleshooting available: With the *Display Authorization Trace* app you can enable an authorization trace for a business user, which helps you to find out if the user’s authorizations are insufficient.

## Debugging

You can use the ABAP Debugger in ABAP Development Tools to gain more insights about authorization checks. You can do so by activating a breakpoint next to the performed `AUTHORITY-CHECK` as well as by adjusting the breakpoint activation to be effective for the relevant developer user.
