# Application Jobs



You can use this app to schedule and monitor application-related jobs. If you have manual activities that you often need to do at a specific time, the `Application Jobs` app can reduce your workload by running these tasks smoothly in the background. Planning regular jobs will keep you free to concentrate on other tasks.

The application job framework ideally defines long-running, repeated jobs. It's not recommended to use it to define short-running jobs with a high frequency. See also [Technical Limits and Boundary Conditions for ABAP Applications](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-btp-abap-environment/abap-environment/development-in-abap-environment?version=Cloud#technical-limits-and-boundary-conditions-for-abap-applications).



## Key Features

You can use this app to:



-   Schedule jobs based on a job template: Select a job template, define the description, start date, start time and recurrence of the job, and enter job-specific selection criteria and parameters

-   Work with personalized job templates: Create and personalize a job template, save personalized job template for later use, and share personalized template

    > ### Note:  
    > The parameters under *Scheduling Information* can't be saved as part of a template.

-   Schedule jobs with a custom factory calendar: In the `Application Jobs` app, define the scheduling information, change an existing calendar, create a new one, and define execution days

-   Arrange job series that take different time zones into account

-   Monitor jobs

-   Display logs and results: You can navigate to job logs and job results by selecting the icon in the *Log* or the *Results* column

-   Copy a job
