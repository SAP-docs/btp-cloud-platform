# Troubleshooting for the Telemetry Module

Troubleshoot problems related to the Telemetry module and its pipelines.



<a name="loiob86d7cb096bb45af82f00463b24c4334__section_troubleshoot_no_data"/>

## No Data Arrive at the Backend



### Symptom

-   No data arrive at the backend.

-   In the pipeline status, the `TelemetryFlowHealthy` condition has status ***GatewayAllTelemetryDataDropped*** or ***AgentAllTelemetryDataDropped***.




### Cause

The pipeline cannot connect to the backend and drops all data, typically because of one of the following reasons:

-   Authentication Error: The credentials in your `MetricPipeline` output are incorrect.

-   Network Unreachable: The backend URL is wrong, a firewall is blocking the connection, or there's a DNS issue preventing the agent or gateway from reaching the backend.

-   Backend is Down: The observability backend itself is not running or is unhealthy.




### Solution

1.  Identify the failing component.

    -   If the status is ***GatewayAllTelemetryDataDropped***, the problem is with the gateway.

    -   If the status is ***AgentAllTelemetryDataDropped***, the problem is with the agent.


2.  To check the failing component's logs, call <code>kubectl logs -n kyma-system <i class="varname">&lt;POD_NAME&gt;</i></code>:

    -   For the gateway, check Pod <code>telemetry-<i class="varname">&lt;log/trace/metric&gt;</i>-gateway</code>.

    -   For the agent, check Pod <code>telemetry-<i class="varname">&lt;log/metric&gt;</i>-agent</code>.


    Look for errors related to authentication, connectivity, and DNS.

3.  Check if the backend is up and reachable.

4.  Based on the log messages, fix the `output` section of your pipeline and re-apply it.

## Not All Data Arrive at the Backend



### Symptom

-   The backend is reachable and the connection is properly configured, but some data points are refused.

-   In the pipeline status, the `TelemetryFlowHealthy` condition has status ***GatewaySomeTelemetryDataDropped*** or ***AgentSomeTelemetryDataDropped***.




### Cause

This status indicates that the telemetry gateway or agent is successfully sending data, but the backend is rejecting some of it. Common reasons are:

-   Rate Limiting: Your backend is rejecting requests because you're sending too much data at once.

-   Invalid Data: Your backend is rejecting specific data due to incorrect formatting, invalid labels, or other schema violations.




### Solution

1.  Check the error logs for the affected Pod by calling `kubectl logs -n kyma-system {POD_NAME}`:

    -   For ***GatewaySomeTelemetryDataDropped***, check Pod <code>telemetry-<i class="varname">&lt;log/trace/metric&gt;</i>-gateway</code>.

    -   For ***AgentSomeTelemetryDataDropped***, check Pod <code>telemetry-<i class="varname">&lt;log/metric&gt;</i>-agent</code>.


2.  Go to your observability backend and investigate potential causes.

3.  If the backend is limiting the rate by refusing data, try the following options:

    -   Increase the ingestion rate of your backend \(for example, by scaling out your SAP Cloud Logging instances\).

    -   Reduce emitted data by re-configuring the pipeline \(for example, by disabling certain inputs or applying filters\).

    -   Reduce emitted data in your applications.


4.  Otherwise, fix the issues as indicated in the logs.

## Gateway Throttling



### Symptom

In the pipeline status, the `TelemetryFlowHealthy` condition has status ***GatewayThrottling***.



### Cause

The gateway is receiving data faster than it can process and forward it.



### Solution

Manually scale out the capacity by increasing the number of replicas for the affected gateway. For details, see [Telemetry CRD](https://kyma-project.io/#/telemetry-manager/user/resources/01-telemetry).

## Custom Spans Don’t Arrive at the Backend, but Istio Spans Do



### Symptom

You see traces generated by the Istio service mesh, but traces from your own application code \(custom spans\) are missing.



### Cause

The OpenTelemetry \(OTel\) SDK version used in your application is incompatible with the OTel Collector version.



### Solution

1.  Check which SDK version you're using for instrumentation.

2.  Investigate whether it's compatible with the OTel Collector version.

3.  If necessary, upgrade to a supported SDK version.

## Too Few Traces Arrive at the Backend



### Symptom

The observability backend shows significantly fewer traces than the number of requests your application receives.



### Cause

By default, Istio samples only 1% of requests for tracing to minimize performance overhead \(see [Configure Istio Tracing](configure-istio-tracing-3f504d8.md)\).

For example, in low-traffic environments \(for development or testing\) or for low-traffic services, the request volume can be so low that a 1% sample rate may result in capturing zero traces.



### Solution

-   To see more traces in the backend, increase the percentage of requests that are sampled \(see [Configure the Sampling Rate](configure-istio-tracing-3f504d8.md#loio3f504d838f7841d19aac71baaa1801e9__section_configure_sampling_rate)\).

-   Alternatively, to trace a single request, force sampling by adding a `traceparent` HTTP header to your client request. This header contains a sampled flag that instructs the system to capture the trace, bypassing the global sampling rate \(see [Trace Context: Sampled Flag](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#sampled-flag)\).

## Log Entry: Failed to Scrape Prometheus Endpoint



### Symptom

-   Your custom Prometheus metrics don't appear in your observability backend.

-   In the metric agent \(OTel Collector\) logs, you see entries saying ***Failed to scrape Prometheus endpoint*** like the following:

    > ### Output Code:  
    > ```
    > 2023-08-29T09:53:07.123Z warn internal/transaction.go:111 Failed to scrape Prometheus endpoint {"kind": "receiver", "name": "prometheus/app-pods", "data_type": "metrics", "scrape_timestamp": 1693302787120, "target_labels": "{__name__=\"up\", instance=\"10.42.0.18:8080\", job=\"app-pods\"}"}
    > ```




### Cause

There's a configuration or network issue between the metric agent and your application, such as:

-   The Service that exposes your metrics port doesn't specify the application protocol.

-   The workload is not configured to use `STRICT` mTLS mode, which the metric agent uses by default.

-   A deny-all `NetworkPolicy` in your application's namespace prevents the agent from scraping metrics from annotated workloads.




### Solution

-   Define the application protocol in the Service port definition by either prefixing the port name with the protocol, or define the `appProtocol` attribute.

-   If the issue is with mTLS, either configure your workload to use `STRICT` mTLS, or switch to unencrypted scraping by adding the `prometheus.io/scheme: "http"` annotation to your workload.

-   Create a new `NetworkPolicy` to explicitly allow ingress traffic from the metric agent; such as the following example:

    ```
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: NetworkPolicy
    metadata:
      name: allow-traffic-from-agent
    spec:
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app.kubernetes.io/name: "annotated-workload" # <your workload here>
      ingress:
      - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kyma-system
          podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              telemetry.kyma-project.io/metric-scrape: "true"
      policyTypes:
      - Ingress
    ```

## Log Buffer Filling Up



### Symptom

In the `LogPipeline` status, the `TelemetryFlowHealthy` condition has status ***AgentBufferFillingUp***.



### Cause

The backend ingestion rate is too low compared to the export rate of the log agent, causing data to accumulate in its buffer.



### Solution

You can either increase the capacity of your backend or reduce the volume of log data being sent. Try one of the following options:

-   Increase the ingestion rate of your backend \(for example, by scaling out your SAP Cloud Logging instances\).

-   Reduce emitted data by re-configuring the pipeline \(for example, by disabling certain inputs or applying namespace filters\).

-   Reduce the amount of log data generated by your applications.
