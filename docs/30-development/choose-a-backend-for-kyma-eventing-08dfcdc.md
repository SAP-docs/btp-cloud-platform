## Context

You can send and receive events in Kyma with the built-in eventing infrastructure. By default, Kyma clusters have no eventing backend defined. You must set up an eventing backend, either based on the NATS technology or SAP Event Mesh.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to Kyma dashboard. The URL is in the *Overview* section of your subaccount.

2.  Go to the `kyma-system` namespace.

3.  Go to *Kyma* \> *Eventing*, open the `eventing` resource, and choose *Edit*.

4.  Under *Backend Type*, select your preferred backend.

5.  If you selected *EventMesh*, go to *Event Mesh Secret*, and select the namespace and name of your SAP Event Mesh service binding.

    > ### Remember:  
    > If you selected *NATS*, make sure the Kyma NATS module is enabled.
