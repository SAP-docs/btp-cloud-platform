# Creating Service Keys

You can use service keys to generate credentials to communicate directly with a service instance. Once you configure them for your service, local clients, apps in other spaces, or entities outside your deployment can access your service with these keys.

You can usethe SAP BTP cockpit or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface to create service keys:

-   [Create Service Keys Using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](create-service-keys-using-the-cloud-foundry-command-line-interface-7de6b31.md)
