# Core Data and Services \(CDS\) Language Reference Documentation

CDS is the backbone of the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\). It provides the means to declaratively capture service definitions and data models, queries, and expressions in plain \(JavaScript\) object notations. CDS features to parse from a variety of source languages and to compile them into various target languages.

CDS models are plain JavaScript objects complying to the Core Schema Notation \(CSN\), an open specification derived from JSON Schema. You can easily create or interpret these models, which foster extensions by 3rd-party contributions. Models are processed dynamically at runtime and can also be created dynamically.

For further information, please refer to the following sections:

-   [Definition Language \(CDL\)](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cdl) - A reference and overview of all CDS concepts and features in the form of compact examples.

-   [Schema Notation \(CSN\)](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/csn) - Specification of CSN, CDS’ canonical format for representing CDS models as plain JavaScript objects, similar to JSON Schema.

-   [Query Language \(CQL\)](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cql) - Documents the CDS Query Language \(aka CQL\) which is an extension of the standard SQL SELECT statement.

-   [Query Notation \(CQN\)](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cqn) - Specification of the Core Query Notation \(CQN\) format that is used to capture queries as plain JavaScript objects.

-   [Expression Notation \(CXN\)](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cxn) - Specification of the Core Expression Notation \(CXN\) used to capture expressions as plain JavaScript objects.

-   [Common Types & Aspects](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/common) - Introduces `@sap/cds/common` a prebuilt CDS model shipped with `@sap/cds` that provides common types and aspects.

-   [Common Annotations](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/annotations) - A reference and glossary of common annotations intrinsically supported by the CDS compiler and runtimes.

-   [Node.js API](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/js-api) - The CDS compiler is implemented in Node.js. Find here the reference documentation for the respective APIs which can be used in CLI tools as well at runtime in CDS service implementations.
