# Configure Timeout of @sap/approuter Component of a Communication Arrangement for Inbound Communication with Service Key OAuth

By default, communication between the approuter and connected services is timed out after 30 seconds. This default value is suitable for most applications. However, for long-lasting data transfer, communication lasts longer. If you experience timeouts, you can set the service key parameter `abap_endpoint_timeout` to a value higher than 30 seconds.
