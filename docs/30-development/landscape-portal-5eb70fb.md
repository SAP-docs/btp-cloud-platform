# Landscape Portal

The [Landscape Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-btp-abap-environment/landscape-portal/landscape-portal) acts as a central tool to allow service providers to perform administration tasks such as hibernating systems, creating test tenants and support users, selecting systems for a pre-upgrade, but also lifecycle management operations such as building, deploying and updating product versions, and even guides you through the configuration and deployment of multitenant SaaS solutions.
