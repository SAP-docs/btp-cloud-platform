# Configure a Java Application for Logs and Traces

Configure the collection of log and trace messages generated by a Java application in the Cloud Foundry Environment.



<a name="loio5551c5e4ef15482998adfbfa0aed7f6b__prereq_eml_xt5_2fb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You have bound an application to the SAP Application Logging service. See: [Logging and Tracing](logging-and-tracing-7eb922a.md)

-   You have installed and configured Maven.

-   You use SAP JVM 8 and your <JAVA\_HOME\> environment variable points to this location.

-   You do not have any SLF4J and logback JAR files in the application.


> ### Caution:  
> The JARs for the *SLF4J* and *logback* are included as part of the Tomcat and TomEE 7 runtimes provided by the SAP Java buildpack. Packing them in the application could cause problems during class loading.



## Context

The recommended framework for logging is Simple Logging Facade for Java \(SLF4J\). To use this framework, you can create an instance of the *org.slf4j.Logger* and *org.slf4j.LoggerFactory* classes. You can use SLF4J to configure your Java application to generate logs and traces, and if appropriate – set the logging and tracing levels.

> ### Note:  
> It is the application's responsibility to ensure that *logback* is configured in a secure way in the cases when the application overrides the default logback configuration included in the SAP Java buildpack. See step 2 below.



## Procedure

1.  Instruct Maven that the application should not package the SLF4J dependency.

    Since this dependency is already provided by the runtime, use the folowing scope in order not to pack the *slf4j-api* in your application.

    ```
    <dependency>
     <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
     <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
     <version>1.7.12</version>
     <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
    ```

2.  \(Optional\) Configure the logback in case the application overrides the default logback configuration. To do that, you need to do the following two steps:

    1.  Create a custom `logback.xml` file. For example:

        > ### Example:  
        > ```
        > <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        > <configuration debug="false" scan="false">
        > 	<contextListener class="ch.qos.logback.classic.jul.LevelChangePropagator"/>
        > 
        >     <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        >         <encoder class="${encoder}">
        >             ${pattern}
        >         </encoder>
        >     </appender>
        > 
        >     <root level="INFO">
        >         <appender-ref ref="STDOUT"/>
        >     </root>
        > 
        > </configuration>
        > ```

    2.  Add the following property in your `manifest.yml` file. For example \(using Tomcat\):

        > ### Example:  
        > ```
        > 
        > ---
        > applications:
        > - name: <APP_NAME>
        > 
        >   ...
        >   env:
        > 	JBP_CONFIG_RESOURCE_CONFIGURATION: "['tomcat/webapps/ROOT/META-INF/.sap_java_buildpack/tomcat/conf/logback.xml': {'encoder': 'com.sap.hcp.cf.logback.encoder.JsonEncoder', 'pattern': ''}]"
        > ```
