# Configure a Java Application for Logs and Traces

Configure the collection of log and trace messages generated by a Java application in SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry.



<a name="loio5551c5e4ef15482998adfbfa0aed7f6b__prereq_eml_xt5_2fb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You have bound an application to the SAP Application Logging service. See: [Logging and Tracing](logging-and-tracing-7eb922a.md)

-   You have installed and configured Maven.

-   For **SAP Java Buildpack 1**: You use SAP JVM 8 or SapMachine 11 or 17, and your <JAVA\_HOME\> environment variable points to this location.

-   For **SAP Java Buildpack 2**: You use SapMachine 17 or 21, and your <JAVA\_HOME\> environment variable points to this location.

-   You do **not** have any SLF4J and logback JAR files in the application.


> ### Caution:  
> The JARs for the *SLF4J* and *logback* are included as part of the Tomcat and TomEE 7 runtimes provided by SAP Java Buildpack. Packing them in the application can cause problems during class loading.



## Context

The recommended framework for logging is Simple Logging Facade for Java \(SLF4J\). To use this framework, you can create an instance of the *org.slf4j.Logger* and *org.slf4j.LoggerFactory* classes. You can use SLF4J to configure your Java application to generate logs and traces, and if appropriate â€“ set the logging and tracing levels.

> ### Note:  
> It is the application's responsibility to ensure that *logback* is configured in a secure way in the case when the application overrides the default logback configuration included in SAP Java Buildpack. See step 2 below.



## Procedure

1.  Instruct Maven that the application should not package the SLF4J dependency, since it's already provided by the runtime.

    To do that, go to the **`pom.xml`** file and set scope **provided** for the following dependency:

    -   For SAP Java Buildpack 1:

        ```
        <dependency>
         <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
         <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
         <version>1.7.36</version>
         <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
        ```

    -   For SAP Java Buildpack 2:

        ```
        <dependency>
         <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
         <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
         <version>2.0.13</version>
         <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
        ```


2.  \(Optional\) Configure the logback in case the application overrides the default logback configuration. To do that, you need to do the following steps:

    1.  Under path `META-INF/sap_java_buildpack/resources/tomcat/conf`, create a custom **`logback.xml`** file. For example:

        > ### Example:  
        > ```
        > <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        > <configuration debug="false" scan="false">
        > 	<contextListener class="ch.qos.logback.classic.jul.LevelChangePropagator"/>
        > 
        >     <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        >         <encoder class="${encoder}">
        >             ${pattern}
        >         </encoder>
        >     </appender>
        > 
        >     <root level="INFO">
        >         <appender-ref ref="STDOUT"/>
        >     </root>
        > 
        > </configuration>
        > ```

    2.  Create a **`resource_configuration.yml`** file or add the following entries to your existing **`resource_configuration.yml`** file \(if using Tomcat\):

        > ### Example:  
        > ```
        > 
        > ---
        > tomcat/conf/logback.xml:
        >   pattern: ''
        >   encoder: ''
        > ```

        **NOTE:** You can also add some default values for `pattern` and `encoder`.

    3.  Add the following property in your **`manifest.yml`** file. For example \(if using Tomcat\):

        > ### Example:  
        > ```
        > 
        > ---
        > applications:
        > - name: <APP_NAME>
        > 
        >   ...
        >   env:
        > 	JBP_CONFIG_RESOURCE_CONFIGURATION: "['tomcat/conf/logback.xml': {'encoder': 'com.sap.hcp.cf.logback.encoder.JsonEncoder', 'pattern': ''}]"
        > ```
