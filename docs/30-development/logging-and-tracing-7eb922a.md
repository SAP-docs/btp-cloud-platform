# Logging and Tracing



<a name="loio7eb922a1668a435d8bd681263e0be12e__context_nwf_1vd_p2b"/>

## Context

SAP Java Buildpack integrates the [Cloud Foundry Java Logging Support](https://github.com/SAP/cf-java-logging-support) libraries, allowing applications to produce logs in the JSON format that can be parsed by the SAP Application Logging service for SAP BTP.



## Procedure

1.  Bind the application to the [SAP Application Logging](https://help.sap.com/docs/application-logging-service/sap-application-logging-service/what-is-sap-application-logging-service?version=Cloud) service. This way, you can produce application logs and forward them to a central application logging stack.

2.  If you want to generate request metrics for applications using a Tomcat or a TomEE application container, add **com.sap.hcp.cf.logging.servlet.filter.RequestLoggingFilter** to the `web.xml` file.

    ```
    <filter-name>request-logging</filter-name>
       <filter-class>com.sap.hcp.cf.logging.servlet.filter.RequestLoggingFilter</filter-class>
    </filter>
    <filter-mapping>
       <filter-name>request-logging</filter-name>
       <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>
    ```

    > ### Note:  
    > The default log level of *com.sap.hcp.cf.logging.servlet.filter.RequestLoggingFilter* is set to INFO.

3.  Check the logs of the application.

    If the binding of your application to the SAP Application Logging service is successful, the application logs can be found on **`https://logs.cf.<LANDSCAPENAME>`**. To request the logs of your application, run:

    ```
    cf logs <app_name> --recent
    ```

4.  \(Optional\) Change the log level of a logging location.

    To do that, configure the SET\_LOGGING\_LEVEL environment variable in the **`manifest.yml`** file. You need to restart your application after that. For example:

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ```
    > 
    > env:
    >   SET_LOGGING_LEVEL: '{com.sap.sample.java.LogInfo: INFO, com.sap.sample.java.LogWarn: WARN}'
    > ```

    **NOTE:** Changing log levels is only applicable for applications running on TomEE and Tomcat containers. Java Main is not supported.
