The following graphic is designed to help you find the information you need for your programming purposes. The bottom row represents the tools, frameworks, services, and deployment options recommended by SAP. If you want full flexibility you can also bring your own development tools and languages, as shown in the top row.

## The Recommended Path

This development approach offers guidance for important development decisions and features proven best practices recommended by SAP. You can follow a model path for application and service development that is based on the Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\). When working with CAP, we recommend using Java and Node.js because they receive the highest level of tool support and are well suited for most use cases. This path provides you with a list of key aspects to consider, but the order shown in these steps isn't mandatory. You can adapt the steps as you wish to better fit your use case.

## Choose Your Own Path

Because of the polyglot nature of the Cloud Foundry environment, you're also free to choose your own approach. You're not forced to use one language exclusively, but can choose between Java, Node.js, and Python. Concerning tools you can either use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface \(CF CLI\) or other tools to develop and deploy your application. You're also free to decide if you want to develop and deploy your applications in the multitarget format \(MTA\).
