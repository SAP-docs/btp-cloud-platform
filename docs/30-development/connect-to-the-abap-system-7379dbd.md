7.  \[Optional:\] If you want to change the name of the project, enter a new name in the *Project Name* field.

    > ### Note:  
    > When you create the project, the `ZLOCAL` ABAP package is added by default to your *Favorite Packages*. This ABAP package including all subpackages contains all local objects from every user of the ABAP system.
    > 
    > To add further ABAP packages to your *Favorite Packages*, choose *Add...* and enter the name of the package in the corresponding input field. Note that this package must be available in the system.
