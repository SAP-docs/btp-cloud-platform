# Creating the BAdI Definition

Create a BAdI definition to provide your business add-in to the customer.

When creating a BAdI definition, please pay attention that some features may not be used, as indicated in the table below. When registering your BAdI for use within the *Custom Logic* app, make sure to perform a compatability check to verify that all restrictions are met.

## Naming Conventions

The description of the BAdI should relate to, or be, a noun. For example, the description of the BAdI that converts A to B should rather be “A To B Conversion” than “Convert A To B”. The technical \(ABAP\) name should be derived from the description \(shortened to 30 characters maximum, upper case only\). The description and the technical name of the BAdI are visible to the customer.

Do not use technical terms like “Enhancement Spot”, “Extensibility”, or “Customer” in the description and in the technical name.

For the interface parameter names, use the following naming convention: Use `BUSINESSPARTNER` as importing parameter instead of `IV_BP_ID`. Do not use technical names, abbreviations, or the hungarian notation.



## BAdI Interface

Define the method for the BAdI. Note that the BAdI interface must include the interface `IF_BADI_INTERFACE`, and no other interfaces should be included. Choose a name for the method, and remember to use exactly one method for the interface. Note the following restrictions for the interface **method signature**:

-   Use only `IMPORTING` and `CHANGING` parameters. Use `CHANGING` parameters only for the output. This requirement is due to the BAdI framework and limitations of the app.

-   Consider `CHANGING` parameters as returning parameters from the key users' point of view, which means that you shouldn't pass values through the parameters.

-   Use `TYPE` as the typing method.

-   The use of released CDS entities as parameters is allowed.

-   The method must have the exception `CX_BLE_RUNTIME_ERROR` in its `RAISING` clause. No other exceptions must be raised. The framework catches all catchable exceptions, logs them and re-throws them as `CX_BLE_RUNTIME_ERROR`.

-   The table type is allowed for `IMPORTING` and `CHANGING` parameters. Please use a limited number of fields to reduce the complexity.

-   Nested tables are technically allowed for both `IMPORTING` and `CHANGING` parameters, but they should only be used in exceptional cases where their usage simplifies the process.

-   Please use only a limited number of `IMPORTING` or `CHANGING` parameters.


> ### Note:  
> Whenever possible, make the method signatures self-contained by using parameter types which you define directly in ABAP within the BAdI interface. Example: `TYPES ty_name TYPE c LENGTH 30.`



## Additional Notes

All ABAP Dictionary types that are used in the parameter typing must be C1-released with the visibility *Use in Key User Apps*. It's often useful to create wrapper classes to control the set of released data types. Furthermore, any catchable exception raised from the key user coding \(directly or indirectly by called methods\) will be caught and re-raised in the previous field of `CX_BLE_RUNTIME_ERROR`. This is done by a try-catch statement that is automatically wrapped around the key user's coding. Variable `IMPLEMENTATION_NAME` of exception `CX_BLE_RUNTIME_ERROR` contains the name of the implementation where the error occurred. If you show messages to the user, remember to always mention this implementation, so that the key user has a chance to find the error and fix it. Adding to that, non-catchable exceptions will still cause a backend dump, as in for example:

`ITAB_DUPLICATE_KEY`: Updating the unique table key `PRIMARY_KEY` resulted in a duplicate entry.



## BAdI Filter Definition

Define a filter for your BAdI definition. Note that filter usage in BAdI implementations is restricted: Filters shouldn't overlap. To make sure that this is not the case, the filters of two distinct implementations of the same BAdI definition should not be `true` at the same time. See the table below for more restrictions and requirements when defining filters:

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> ### Note:  
> When implementing the BAdI, the key user maintains filter values to specify under which conditions the implementation will be called at runtime. The *Custom Logic* app only allows the definition of conditions in disjunctive normal form, and only allows comparisons containing a single operator. For example: `(area =1 AND category > 0 AND volume > 0 AND volume <= 100) OR (area = 1 AND category > 1 AND volume > 100 AND volumn <= 199) OR ...`
> 
> Key users can maintain the conditions in a form-based editor. At runtime, at most one customer-provided implementation will be executed



## Tenant Prefix Filter

Add a filter called `TENANT_PREFIX` with the type `CHARACTER` to your BAdI definition. This filter ensures that only BAdI implementations for the current tenant are executed at runtime. In your code, obtain the current tenant's prefix by using the ABAP API `cl_ble_api_mt_tenant`. The method `GET_PREFIX` returns the tenant prefix.

In the following example, the demo class `zcl_badi_demo` is used to illustrate the usage of `cl_ble_api_mt_tenant`. `z_badi` could be any BAdI that you want to register for use within the *Custom Logic* app.

```abap
CLASS zcl_badi_demo DEFINITION PUBLIC FINAL CREATE PUBLIC.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS:
      my_method.
ENDCLASS.
 
CLASS zcl_badi_demo IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD my_method.
    DATA(lo_tenant_api) = cl_ble_api_mt_tenant=>create_instance( ).
    DATA(lv_tenant_prefix) = lo_tenant_api->get_prefix( ).
 
    DATA lo_badi TYPE REF TO z_badi.
    GET BADI lo_badi FILTERS tenant_prefix = lv_tenant_prefix.
    CALL BADI lo_badi->execute.
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

```
