Delete or do not deploy the old app-host instance or use another app.id in the resources folder for a new app-host.

### 400: Failed to run the application router after subscription; route not found

</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">

Cause

</td>
<td valign="top">

In order to support subscriptions out of the box, a route with format \*.<custom-domain\> should be created and mapped to the application router. The \* host represents a wildcard that is replaced by the actual subscriber subdomain during runtime.

Without a custom domain, this type of route \(wildcard host\) cannot be created; only a fixed host can be used. Without a custom domain, the route format is <subdomain\>-<myapprouter\>.<scp domain\>. It means that you have to create a route with the expected subdomain for each new subscriber.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Solution

In development setups, if you don't have a custom domain before subscription, then create a route with the expected subscriber subdomain.

Issue

When trying to upload content, it fails with error: "Upload failed".

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Cause

</td>
<td valign="top">

One or more of the input validations performed by HTML5 application repository failed. The possible validation failures are:

1.  Missing manifest.json file on the root level.

2.  manifest.json app.id has invalid characters \(hyphens, @, %, &, etc.\).

3.  manifest.json app.version is not using the following format: *xx.xx.xx*, where x must be an integer \(e.g.: -snapshot is not supported\).

4.  app.id of one or more of the applications already exists in another html5-apps-repo/app-host service instance in the same space.




</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Solution

</td>
<td valign="top">

Check if one of the causes is your issue. For example, check the size of your html5-app-deployer resources folder, check manifest.json. If you are not sure if another service instance already uses your app.id, try making a small change to your app.id and deploy it again.

Cause

</td>
<td valign="top">

If something happens during the upload, it might cause some inconsistencies.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Solution

</td>
<td valign="top">

Delete the content of one or more multiple app-hosts, and reset the state to initial without deleting the service instances. Use the following command line in the CF CLI HTML5 application repository plug-in:

```
cf html5-delete --content <app-host-id> [...]
```

Cause

</td>

The zipped application file length exceeds the size limit of the app-host service instance.

The `cf push` plugin checks if the start process is finished. If the process times out, then it tries to start it again.

Issue

</td>

The HTML5 application repository does not serve content. The application log displays the following message: "Application xyz does not exist."

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Cause

</td>
<td valign="top">

This issue can have different causes:

-   Cause 1: The application name in the URL is incorrect.

    Application names in the HTML5 application repository do not use periods \(“.”\) as separators in the URL. For example: if the `app.id` in the `manifest.json` file is <code>country<b>.</b>list</code>, the application name is `countrylist`. Use this name in the URL.

-   Cause 2: The request URL does not include the application key.

    A request to the application router must include the application key in the URL. The application router uses the application key to fetch the xs-app.json file of the HTML5 application from the HTML5 application repository. The application key can include the business service prefix, application name, and application version. \(Only the application name is required.\)




</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Solution

</td>
<td valign="top">

1.  Check the application name. In the request URL, use the application name without periods as separators.

2.  If the application name is correct, check if the request URL to the application router includes the application key. If the URL does not include the application key, review how you configured the backend application data retrieval in your HTML5 application:

    -   If you use SAP Fiori tools, such as SAP Business Application Studio, check the `dataSources.uri`property in the `manifest.json` file. The value for `dataSources.uri` property must **not** start with a slash \("/"\). For example: `northwind/V2/Northwind.svc` is correct, but <code><b>/</b>northwind/V2/Northwind.svc</code> is incorrect. A leading slash creates an absolute path, which prevents the browser from concatenating the application key for the request. If there is a leading slash, remove it.

    -   If you use a JQueryAjax call for the request, make sure the URL provided to the JQueryAjax call is a relative path and does not start with a slash \("/"\).

### 404: Calls to service endpoints specified in an application's xs-app.json fails

You have defined routes in a UI app's local xs-app.json but calls do not get routed and instead return a 404 error.

Cause

</td>
<td valign="top">

The routes in the xs-app.json file are processed top to bottom. If a route maps the pattern, it is picked even if a route below it is a better match. The route for the HTML5 application repository typically is a "catch all" route, and if any routes are defined below it, then they are never reached.

</td>

Move the route leading to the html5-apps-repo-rt to be the last entry in the xs-app.json file.

Cause

1.  If missing, add the following to the `n xs-security.json` file:

    "scopes": \[ \{ "name": "uaa.user", "description": "UAA" \}\],

    "role-templates": \[ \{"name": "Token\_Exchange","description": "UAA","scope-references": \["uaa.user"\] \} \]

2.  Redeploy or update the XSUAA service instance.

3.  Make sure that the users have the new role\_template, *Token\_Exchange* added to their role\_collections in the SAP BTP cockpit *Global Account* \> *Subaccount* \> *Security* \> *Role Collections* and verify that the created role's *Application Identifier* is the same as the `xsappname` from the xs-security.json.

4.  If the roles of the target business service does not appear on the subscriber tenant UI, it means that the target business service subscription failed or it was bound to the application router after the subscription took place. In this case, try to unsubscribe and subscribe again. Make sure that the target business service roles appear on subscriber tenant UI.

Check that the main page is not configured to be cached by the browser in your xs-app.json file. The best practice is to model the cacheControl as follows:

{
  "routes": [

      "source": "^/ui/index.html",
      "target": "index.html",
      "service": "html5-apps-repo-rt",
