# Creating the Job Catalog Entry

An application job catalog entry contains the information that is needed for scheduling and running an application job. The application job catalog entry contains the name of the class that implements the business logic, and the information on how selection fields are rendered in the job scheduling dialog in the app. In addition, the job catalog entry contains some further settings which are used during the scheduling and running of the application job.

To create a job catalog entry, use the ABAP development tools for Eclipse \(ADT\) editor. For more information, see [Working with Application Job Objects](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-abap-development-user-guide/working-with-application-job-objects?version=Cloud). Alternatively, you could still also create job catalog entries and job templates via a released API. For more information, see [Creating a Job Catalog Entry and a Job Template via API](creating-a-job-catalog-entry-and-a-job-template-via-api-e58737f.md).

Job catalog entries and job templates are created with a package assignment and the objects are assigned to a transport request. You need to make sure that the package and transport request fit together \(regarding the transport layer\) and that possible naming conventions are obeyed.
