# Integration with Approuter

You can integrate the OData service of your ABAP environment into the application by specifying a corresponding route in the `xs-app.json` file of the HTML5 module. The routing can be done either by providing a destination that points to the ABAP environment instance or by specifying the service endpoint of the ABAP environment and binding the service instance.

> ### Note:  
> If the application and the instance of the ABAP environment are deployed to different subaccounts, use routing via destination.

For more information about the two types of routing, navigate to [Routing via Service](routing-via-service-aba737f.md) or [Routing via Destination](routing-via-destination-97d7a02.md).
