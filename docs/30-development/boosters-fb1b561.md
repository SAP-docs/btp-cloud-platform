# Boosters

Boosters are a set of guided interactive steps that enable you to select, configure, and consume services on SAP BTP to achieve a specific technical goal.

You can access them directly from your desired global account in the SAP BTP cockpit, by choosing *Boosters* in the navigation menu. This leads to a page where you can find an overview of all available boosters, grouped by capability. From this overview page, you can get quick information about a booster, start a booster, or choose a tile to access the booster details.

## Booster Details

The details of boosters are organized in 3 tabs:

-   *Overview*

    Here, you can get information about what the booster does, its key features and how that particular booster can help you.

-   *Components*

    Here, you can see all the components that are required for the booster to run.

-   *Additional Resources*

    Here, you find a list of additional information resources where you can learn more about the concepts and components mentioned in the booster.


Boosters automate processes and always achieve a technical goal, often in the form of an artifact. Artifacts are entities that you develop which may consume technical components \(for example, services\). Examples of artifacts include applications, content for integration and workflows, or even documents.

When you start a booster, a wizard opens up which guides you through a set of steps. Following these steps enables you to reach the result described in the booster overview.
