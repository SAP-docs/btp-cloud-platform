-   Tester
    -   Tests the software

        > ### Note:  
        > Depending on your organization, the tasks of this role can be performed by automatic test tools, developers, or dedicated persons that are responsible for executing manual tests.

    -   Needs authorizations for custom business catalogs created via IAM business catalogs for custom apps.

        > ### Caution:  
        > Do not assign catalog `SAP_CORE_BC_EXT_TST` \(Extensibility - Custom Apps and Services\) to a tester.
        > 
        > As this catalog is used to provide an easy test of custom apps or their underlying services in a development ABAP system only by adding them automatically to it during activation, real service tests with own catalogs might not be tested securely. In non-development systems, automatic authorization via business catalog`SAP_CORE_BC_EXT_TST` is not enabled, instead custom authorization is required.
