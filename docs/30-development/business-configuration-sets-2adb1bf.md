# Business Configuration Sets

A Business Configuration Set is a container to group customizing data logically according to business needs. The business configuration set can be activated in a system to deploy its contents to the relevant customizing tables

You can create a business configuration set using either of the following ways:

1.  Using the business configuration set creation wizard in ADT and import content from a customizing transport to the Business Configuration Set. For more information refer [Working with Business Confiuration Sets](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-development-tools-user-guide/working-with-business-configuration-sets)
2.  Using the XCO Generation APIs to create or update a business configuration set by specifying the object template, and to delete the business configuration set. See [Business Configuration Sets](business-configuration-sets-ec48145.md)
