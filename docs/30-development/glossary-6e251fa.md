Add-on build pipeline

</td>
<td valign="top">

Add-on descriptor

</td>
<td valign="top">

The build process is controlled by an add-on descriptor file called `addon.yml`. This file must be created manually and stored in the Git repository of the pipeline. It must contain information about the software product version to be delivered and the containing software component versions. See [Add-On Descriptor File](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/scenarios/abapEnvironmentAddons/#add-on-descriptor-file).

<tr>
<td valign="top">

Add-on installation test system

</td>
<td valign="top">

To verify that the delivery packages included in the add-on product version being built are installable, a target vector is published in "test" scope. In the integration tests stage, an ABAP system of service plan `saas_oem` is created. This ABAP OEM service allows you to install a specific add-on product version into an ABAP system that is provisioned.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Add-on product version \(software product version\)

</td>
<td valign="top">

To install and maintain ABAP software, software product versions are used. A software product version is a bundle of software component versions made available at the same time for implementing a well-defined scope of functionality. See [Software Product Version](https://www.project-piper.io/scenarios/abapEnvironmentAddons/#software-component-version).

ABAP Test Cockpit

</td>
<td valign="top">

ABAP Test Cockpit checks can be executed using `abapEnvironmentRunATCCheck`. The step can receive software components or packages configured in a YML file. The results are returned in checkstyle format. With the use of a pipeline extension, you can configure quality gates. See [ATC](https://www.project-piper.io/pipelines/abapEnvironment/stages/test/#atc) and [ABAP Test Cockpit Configurator](../50-administration-and-ops/abap-test-cockpit-configurator-22c26ff.md).

Branch

</td>
<td valign="top">

Git repository branches can be used to control the flow of changes through the test and production landscape. They separate changes from each other, which shall or might not be delivered together \(i.e. development vs. correction, feature A vs. feature B\). A branch is created on the current state of another branch, the parent branch, and reflected by a new copy of all included objects. Depending on which branch is supposed to be changed, the corresponding copy is worked on.
