# Developing a Data Model and an SQL Service

Before you set up the data access for ODBC-based clients, you must create a data model and an SQL service in ABAP Development Tools.

In this documentation, you can find instructions how to create a few tables with sample data. These tables are used as examples to show how data access for ODBC-based clients works.

In addition, you need CDS view entities for your tables, a service definition, and an SQL-typed service binding.
