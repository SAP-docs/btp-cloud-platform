1.  In the SAP Fiori launchpad of your ABAP system, create a business role with the *Maintain Business Roles* app. See [Maintain Business Roles](https://help.sap.com/viewer/a630d57fc5004c6383e7a81efee7a8bb/LATEST/en-US/8980ad05330b4585ab96a8e09cef4688.html).
2.  Assign a business catalog and business user to the business role. See [Maintain Business Users](https://help.sap.com/viewer/a630d57fc5004c6383e7a81efee7a8bb/LATEST/en-US/e40e710321c74f28916affa9ae984bce.html).
3.  Create a launchpad space and page. See [Step by Step: Create a New Space and Page for a Business Role](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/user-interface-configurations/step-by-step-create-new-space-and-page-for-business-role?version=Cloud).

    > ### Note:  
    > To use this app, your user must be assigned to business catalog `SAP_CORE_BC_UI_FLD`.

4.  Enable spaces for your user. See [Enabling Spaces](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/user-interface-configurations/enabling-spaces?version=Cloud). Optionally, you can personalize and adapt the user interface of your app for all users. See [Personalizing and Adapting Apps](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-fiori-launchpad-for-sap-btp-abap-environment/personalizing-and-adapting-apps?version=Cloud).
5.  As a business user, you can launch the app.
