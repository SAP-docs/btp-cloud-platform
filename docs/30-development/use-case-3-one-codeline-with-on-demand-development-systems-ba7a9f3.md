# Use Case 3: One Codeline with On-Demand Development Systems

You can apply this setup if you have:

-   Small development projects \(for example one SAP Fiori application, one developer\)
-   Occasional development activities \(for example after an initial development phase, it is expected to only implement new features on a yearly basis\)

The ABAP system landscape consists of a permanent production system and an on-demand development system.

![](images/Production_ABAP_system_and_an_on-demand_development_ABAP_system_d7688a6.png)

The advantage of this setup is that you have to administer few systems and only pay for the development system during the development periods. The payment model according to the lifetime of a system requires an SAP BTP enterprise agreement contract.

The disadvantages of this setup are that de-commissioning the development system means losing the change history as well as the configuration and application data.

The user base and authorizations have to be set up each time the development system is provisioned.

Not testing with a transported version of the solution always comes with the risk of forgetting to transport an object. This can be avoided by testing in the development system on the release branch.

> ### Note:  
> A much more production-like test can only be ensured in a non-development system, where the objects of the solution are initially created and changed by pulls, and where there is no authorization automatism for testing, see tester role in [Required Business Roles](required-business-roles-01c96ed.md).
> 
> Using API compatibility checks will not be possible with this use case without a permanent system. For the ATC check required API snapshots are not transported and would be deleted during system deprovisioning. For more information, see [Checking the Compatibility of Released APIs](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-development-tools-user-guide/checking-compatibility-of-released-apis). We thus strongly recommend developing with [Use Case 1: One Codeline in a 3-System Landscape](use-case-1-one-codeline-in-a-3-system-landscape-2276142.md) instead of use case 3. The quality assurance system might be de-/commissioned on demand then.

## For the Go Live

**Starting situation:** 

-   A \(temporary\) development system is set up
-   The production system is set up
-   Both systems are based on the main branch
-   Software Component Relations are defined for dependencies between leading- and reuse software components
