# Emailing

This chapter covers the latest applications for sending, monitoring, and configuring emails.

It focuses exclusively on the latest email API and its related applications. The use of older mail APIs, which some SAP applications might still use, isn't recommended.

The SAP component `BC-SRV-COM` email APIs use SMTP as the sending protocol. They conform to `RFC 822` and `RFC 5322`, ensuring secure and error-free communication between email senders and recipients.
