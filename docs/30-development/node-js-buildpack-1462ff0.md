## Node.js 16 has reached end of life



### Problem

Node.js 16 reached end of life on **September 11, 2023** \(instead of April 2024, as originally planned\), and shortly after was removed from the [community buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack). This means that, after this date, deployment and redeployment of applications running on Node.js 16 would fail. For more information, see:

-   [Node.js Roadmap](https://github.com/nodejs/Release)

-   [Bringing forward the End-of-Life Date for Node.js 16](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/nodejs16-eol)




### Solution

To avoid such issues, please migrate to Node.js 18 or higher as soon as possible!

In exceptional cases \(if you haven’t managed to switch to Node.js 18 or 20 yet\), to avoid application failures during redeployment, you can pin the last buildpack version that contains Node.js 16, as provided by the [nodejs-buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/releases) community. To learn how to do this, see: [Specify a buildpack version in manifest.yml](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/tips-and-tricks-for-node-js-applications?version=Cloud#specify-a-buildpack-version-in-manifest-yml)

Nevertheless, this approach can only be used as a temporary solution, until you complete migration to a later version of Node.js!

## XSJS application stopped working after upgrade to Node v.16



### Problem

You have an XSJS application, which was working fine on Node.js 14.

After an upgrade to Node 16, it fails to rebuild or redeploy and is no longer working. In the logs, you see the following error messages:

```

npm ERR! gyp ERR! command "/opt/nodejs/node-v16.15.0-linux-x64/bin/node"

"/home/user/.node_modules_global/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/bin/node-gyp.js"

"rebuild"npm ERR! gyp ERR! cwd /home/user/projects/DataCentral/dc_node/node_modules/@sap/xsjs/node_modules/@sap/fibers
```

You may also encounter the following error messages:

```

npm WARN EBADENGINE   required: { node: '^10 || ^12 || ^14' },

npm WARN EBADENGINE   current: { node: 'v16.19.0', npm: '8.19.3' }

npm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine {

npm WARN EBADENGINE   package: '@sap/xsjs@6.7.5'
```



### Reason

XSJS applications use the [@sap/fibers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/fibers) library \(on which the [@sap/xsjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/xsjs) package depends\), which is **not supported** on Node.js 16 and later versions.



### Solution

To keep your XSJS applications up and running on latest Node.js versions, you need to migrate them to the new XSJS layer with an asynchronous API. To learn how to do this, see:

-   [Migrating Applications from XSJS to Async-XSJS](migrating-applications-from-xsjs-to-async-xsjs-40ded9d.md)

-   [SAP HANA 2 - ASYNC XS JavaScript API Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/215e6913c0e44223b2842f16c927ec6d/2.0.07/en-US/index.html)

-   [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/async-xsjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/async-xsjs)


> ### Note:  
> Bear in mind that Node.js 14 was removed from the [community buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack) on **April 30, 2023**.

We recommend migration to Node.js 18 or 20, and respectively migration to Async-XSJS, as soon as possible.

In exceptional cases \(if you haven’t managed to complete the migration to Async-XSJS\), to avoid application failures during redeployment, you can pin the last buildpack version that contains Node.js 14, as provided by the [nodejs-buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/releases) community. To learn how to do this, see: [Specify a buildpack version in manifest.yml](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/tips-and-tricks-for-node-js-applications?version=Cloud#specify-a-buildpack-version-in-manifest-yml)

Nevertheless, this approach can only be used as a temporary solution, until you complete the migration!
