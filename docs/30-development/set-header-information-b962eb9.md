# Set Header Information

An application log contains header information and attributes to identify the log. During log creation, the following header information can be set:

-   Log Object \(required\): Identifies the application to which the log belongs.

-   Log Subobject: An application can define subcategories of its log object. These subcategories are called subobjects and must be set if the application defined them. If no subobjects were defined for the log object, the field should remain empty.

-   External Identifier: We recommend to enter your preferred identifier containing, for example, the application document number.

-   Expiry Date: It defines the date when the log expires and can be deleted from the database. The default value is the creation date of the log + 7 days.

-   A flag defining whether it should not be allowed to delete the log before the expiry date by a standard report. The application is still able to delete the log before this date.

-   Context: Allows the storage of application-specific data related to the log. See [Set a Context](set-a-context-0afccc8.md).


To define the log header, an instance of the `IF_BALI_HEADER_SETTER` interface is required. To create this instance, you can use method `CREATE` of class `CL_BALI_HEADER_SETTER`. It allows to set the object, subobject and the external identifier of the application log.

Interface `IF_BALI_HEADER_SETTER` contains the following methods to set or change the header attributes:

-   `SET_DESCRIPTOR`: Changes the object, subobject and external identifier.

-   `SET_EXPIRY`: Sets the expiry date and the *keep until expiry* flag.

-   `SET_CONTEXT`: Sets the context of the log.


> ### Note:  
> You have two options to transfer the header to the application log object:
> 
> -   Using method `CREATE_WITH_HEADER` of class `CL_BALI_LOG` when the log object is created.
> 
> -   Using method `SET_HEADER` of interface `IF_BAL_LOG`.
> 
> 
> If the header was already written to the log \(for example, using method `SET_HEADER` of interface `IF_BAL_LOG`\) and if the header object is changed afterwards \(for example, using method `SET_DESCRIPTOR`\), you must call method `SET_HEADER` to make these changes visible in the log.

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```abap
> 
> ...
>  TRY.
>      DATA(l_header) = cl_bali_header_setter=>create( object = 'ZOBJECT'
>                                                      subobject = 'ZSUBOBJECT'
>                                                      external_id = 'External ID' ).
>      l_header->set_expiry( expiry_date = CONV #( cl_abap_context_info=>get_system_date(  ) + 5 )
>                            keep_until_expiry = abap_true ).
>    CATCH cx_bali_runtime INTO DATA(l_runtime_exception).
>      out->write( l_runtime_exception->get_text(  ) ).
>  ENDTRY.
> ...
