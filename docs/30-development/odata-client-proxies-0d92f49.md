# OData Client Proxies

There are several consumption types and OData versions for your OData Client Proxy configurations, depending on your use case.

## Consumption Types

The OData Client Proxy can be either local or remote.



### Local Client Proxy

Use this Client Proxy for the consumption of an OData service on the current server without HTTP.

-   No HTTP overhead

-   The OData service is processed in the same application session. This allows integration testing, for example, including stubbing.




### Remote Client Proxy

Use this Client Proxy for the consumption of an OData service that is offered on a remote server.

## OData Versions



### **OData Version 2 Client Proxy**

Use this Client Proxy for the consumption of an OData Version 2 service.



### OData Version 4 Client Proxy

Use this Client Proxy for the consumption of OData Version 4 services.

> ### Note:  
> These configurations \(the OData version and consumption type\) depend on each other. For example, there is a local OData Version 2 Client Proxy or a remote OData Version 4 Client Proxy, but not a local Client Proxy independent of the OData version. The asynchronous Client Proxy is only available for remote consumption of OData Version 4 services.
