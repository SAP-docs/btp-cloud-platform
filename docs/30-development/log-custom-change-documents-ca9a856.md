# Log Custom Change Documents

Change documents defined in custom RAP business objects are automatically logged as business events when the corresponding business is activated for logging in the Activate Business Event Logging configuration.

For information on defining change documents for a managed RAP business object as a customer, see [Enabling Change Documents Integration](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-rap/enabling-rap-change-documents-integration).
