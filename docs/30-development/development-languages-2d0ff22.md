# Development Languages

Learn about the development languages supported in the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment.

The polylglot nature of SAP BTP means that you have the freedom to choose between various development languages. While we do recommend using Java and Node.js for most use cases, you're free to use the language that best suits your development needs.

Find more information on the three main languages supported by SAP by following the links below:

> ### Note:  
> Please be informed that the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime Cloud Service is an open Platform-as-a-Service targeted at microservice development and orchestration. SAP is a member of the Cloud Foundry Foundation, which provides Cloud Foundry, a model for cloud-native application delivery. SAP allows use of certain, publicly available, system buildpacks that are supported by the Cloud Service. However, SAP is not in possession or control of, and cannot be responsible for the content, operation, or use of such system buildpacks, which are not part of the Cloud Service \(including SAP Business Technology Platform\).
> 
> SAP may, without notice, remove any system buildpacks at any time and at SAP’s own discretion.
