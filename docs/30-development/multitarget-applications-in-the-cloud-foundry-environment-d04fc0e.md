# Multitarget Applications in the Cloud Foundry Environment

A Multitarget application \(MTA\) is essentially a single application that consists of multiple parts. These parts are created using various technologies and share the same lifecycle.

The MTA developers outline the intended outcomes using the MTA model. This model consists of MTA modules, MTA resources, and the interdependencies between them. Afterward, the SAP Cloud Deployment service validates it, orchestrates the necessary actions, and automates the MTA deployment. The outcome is the formation of Cloud Foundry applications, services, and the generation of SAP specific content. For more information about the Multitarget Application model, see the official specification documents [The Multitarget Application Model v.2](https://help.sap.com/doc/multitarget-application-modelv2/Cloud/en-US/The%20Multitarget%20Application%20Model.pdf) and [The Multitarget Application Model v.3](https://help.sap.com/doc/multitarget-application-modelv3/Cloud/en-US/The%20Multitarget%20Application%20M%D0%BEdel.pdf).

You can create and deploy a Multitarget Application in the Cloud Foundry environment as described below by following different approaches that can yield the same result:

-   Using SAP Web IDE Full-Stack as described in [Developing Multitarget Applications](https://help.sap.com/viewer/825270ffffe74d9f988a0f0066ad59f0/CF/en-US/a71bf8281254489ea8be6e323199b304.html) - both the development descriptor `mta.yaml` and the deployment descriptor `mtad.yaml` are created automatically. The `mta.yaml` is generated when you create the application project, and the `mtad.yaml` file is created when you build the project.

    > ### Note:  
    > You may still need to edit the development descriptor.

    Development descriptors are used to generate MTA deployment descriptors, which define the required deployment data. That is, the MTA development descriptor data specifies what you want to build, how to build it, while the deployment descriptor data specifies as what and how to deploy it.

-   Using Business Application Studio - the flow is similar to WebIDE but the development is done from BAS.

-   Using the [Cloud MTA Build Tool](https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/). Afterward, you deploy the MTA using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface.

    > ### Note:  
    > An MTA development descriptor `mta.yaml` is required. You have to create it manually.

-   Manually - create the required files manually and deploy them using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface

    > ### Note:  
    > An MTA development descriptor `mta.yaml` is not explicitly required. In this case, a deployment descriptor is maintained instead.

    1.  Create the required files using an IDE of your choice.
    2.  To produce your custom artifacts, use a build technology of your choice.
    3.  Maintain your deployment descriptor document \(`mtad.yaml`\).
        1.  \(Optional\) If you want to have an MTA archive package, use the `mbt assemble`. For more information, see [Cloud MTA Build Tool \(MBT\)](https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/).

        2.  Use the `cf deploy` command to deploy the MTA package or directly from the build result directory.

Multitarget application \(MTA\)

An application comprised of multiple software modules, which are created with different technologies and deployed to different runtimes.

Development descriptor

</td>
<td valign="top">

A `YAML` file named `mta.yaml` that contains a list of all entities, such as modules, resources, and properties that belong to an application or are used by it at runtime, and the dependencies between them. It is automatically generated when an MTA project is created or modified, or when a module is added or removed. The developer needs to edit the descriptor manually to define resources, properties, and dependencies, as well as fill in missing information.

## Prerequisites and Restrictions

You have to consider the following limits for the MTA artifacts, which can be handled by the SAP Cloud Deployment service:

-   Maximum size of the MTA archive: 4 GB
-   Maximum size of MTA module content: 1 GB
-   Maximum size of MTA resource content: 1 MB
-   Maximum size of MTA descriptors \(`mtad.yaml` and `MANIFEST.MF`\): 1 MB
-   Maximum size of deployments which use multiple MTA archives: 20GB. This restriction is applicable only in transport scenarios via cTMS or CTS+, where one transport request with multiple MTAs results in a single deployment process in SAP Cloud Deployment service.



### Unsupported Cloud Foundry Features

In addition to the features that are not supported by the Cloud Foundry environment on SAP BTP \(See [Supported and Unsupported Cloud Foundry Features](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/cloud-foundry-environment?version=Cloud#supported-and-unsupported-cloud-foundry-features)\), MTA deployment in Cloud Foundry currently does not support these features as well:

-   Sidecars. See [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/sidecars.html](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/sidecars.html).

-   Route services. See [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/route-services.html](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/route-services.html).

-   Readiness health check. See [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/healthchecks.html](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/healthchecks.html).

-   Health check interval. See [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/healthchecks.html](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/healthchecks.html).

-   Metadata. See [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/metadata.html](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/metadata.html).


> ### Note:  
> These features might be implemented in the future.
