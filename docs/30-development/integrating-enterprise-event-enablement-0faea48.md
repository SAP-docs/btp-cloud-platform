# Integrating Enterprise Event Enablement

In the context of business applications, an event represents a significant change of state that is relevant for follow-up processes. For example, when a new sales order is created, you can use events to trigger additional workflows in other applications.

Event-driven architecture enables asynchronous communication between an event provider and an event consumer in use cases where no direct response from the event consumer is required.

For more information on how to use business events, refer to the [ABAP Integration and Connectivity](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-integration-and-connectivity-eede1416d18c436e8810eaaeb20c38ae/abap-integration-and-connectivity) guide, under [Event-Based Integration](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-integration-and-connectivity-eede1416d18c436e8810eaaeb20c38ae/about-business-events).
