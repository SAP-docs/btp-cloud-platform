# Memory Calculator V1 \(SAP JVM Memory Calculator\)

This memory calculator is optional, and you can activate it by adding the following environment variable:

```
---
applications:
- name: <app-name>
  ...
  env:
    MEMORY_CALCULATOR_V1: true
  ...
```

> ### Restriction:  
> Memory Calculator V1 is only available for [SAP Java Buildpack 1](sap-java-buildpack-1-ad3e8df.md).
> 
> If you try to activate it for [SAP Java Buildpack 2](sap-java-buildpack-2-1cf206b.md), an error will be thrown.

**When deploying applications on Cloud Foundry, developers can specify the memory limit of the application.**

The main goal of the SAP JVM Memory Calculator is to provide mechanism to fine-tune the Java Virtual Machine \(JVM\) so that the JVM's memory grows below this memory limit.

There are three memory types, which can be sized - **heap**, **metaspace**, and **stack**. For each memory type there is a command-line option, which must be passed to the JVM:

-   The initial and maximum size of the *heap* memory is controlled by the `-Xms` and `-Xmx` options, respectively.

-   The initial and maximum size of the *metaspace* memory is controlled by the `-XX:MetaspaceSize` and `-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize` options, respectively.

-   The size of the *stack* is controlled by the `-Xss` option.

## Default Settings

The SAP Java Buildpack is delivered with a default built-in configuration of the memory sizing options in YML format - `config/sapjvm.yml` \(path related to the buildpack archive\). This configuration file is parsed during application staging, and the memory configuration specified in it is used for calculating the memory sizes of `heap`, `metaspace`, and `stack`.

The default structure of the `config/sapjvm.yml` configuration file is the following:

> ### Sample Code:  
> config/sapjvm.yml
> 
> ```
> ---
> repository_root: "{default.repository.root}/sapjvm/{platform}/{architecture}"
> version: +
> memory_calculator:
>   version: 1.+
> repository_root: "{default.repository.root}/memory-calculator/{platform}/{architecture}"
> memory_sizes:
>   heap:
>   metaspace: 64M..
>   stack:
>   native:
> memory_heuristics:
>   heap: 75
>   metaspace: 10
>   stack: 5
>   native: 10
> memory_initials:
>   heap: 100%
>   metaspace: 100%
> memory_settings:
>   codecache:
>   directmemory:
> 
> ```

The **memory\_calculator** section encloses the input data for the memory calculation techniques utilized in determining the JVM memory sizing options.

-   `heap` – configure sizing options for the Java heap. Affects JVM options **`-Xms`** and **`-Xmx`**

-   `metaspace` – configure sizing options for the metaspace. Affects JVM options **`-XX:MetaspaceSize`** and **`-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize`**

-   `stack` – configure sizing options for the stack. Affects JVM option **`-Xss`**

-   `native` – serves to represent the rest of the memory \(different from `heap`, `stack`, `metaspace`\) in the calculations performed by the SAP JVM Memory Calculator. No JVM options are affected by this setting.

-   `memory_heuristics` – this section defines the proportions between the memory regions addressed by the memory calculator. The ratios above will result in a `heap` space that is about 7.5 times larger than the `metaspace` and `native`. The `stack` will be about half of the `metaspace` size.

-   `memory_initials` - this section defines initial and maximum values for `heap` and `metaspace`. By default, the initial values for `heap` and `metaspace` are set to 100%. That means, the memory calculation will result in **`-Xms = -Xmx`** and **`-XX:MetaspaceSize = -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize`**.

    If those values are set to 50%, then **`-Xmx = 2*-Xms`** and **`-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize = 2*-XX:MetaspaceSize`**.

-   `memory_settings` – see: [Out-Of-Memory Behavior](out-of-memory-behavior-588cfd9.md)

-   `memory_sizes` – this section defines sizes of the corresponding memory regions. The size of the memory region could be specified in kilobytes \(by using the K symbol\), megabytes \(by using the M symbol\), and gigabytes \(by using the G symbol\).

## Customize the Default Settings

There are two ways to customize the default settings - during application staging and during application runtime.



### Customizing the defaults during application staging

-   Customize the memory options by using the *JBP\_CONFIG\_SAPJVM* environment variable

    ```
      ---
      applications:
      - name: <app-name>
        memory: 512M
      ...
        env:
          JBP_CONFIG_SAPJVM:  "[memory_calculator: {memory_heuristics: {heap: 85, stack: 10}}]"
    ```

-   Customize the memory options by using the *JBP\_CONFIG\_SAPJVM\_MEMORY\_\** environment variables

    ```
      ---
      applications:
      - name: <app-name>
        memory: 512M
      ...
        env:
          JBP_CONFIG_SAPJVM_MEMORY_SIZES: 'heap:30m..400m,stack:2m..,metaspace:10m..12m'
          JBP_CONFIG_SAPJVM_MEMORY_WEIGHTS: 'heap:5,stack:1,metaspace:3,native:1'
          JBP_CONFIG_SAPJVM_MEMORY_INITIALS: "heap:50%,metaspace:50%"
    ```




### Customizing the defaults during application runtime

There are several ways to customize the SAP JVM Memory Calculator's settings during the application runtime. All of them include executing the `set-env` command – either on XSA or on Cloud Foundry. Below are some examples:

-   By using the JBP\_CONFIG\_SAPJVM environment variable

    ```
    cf set-env sapjbp-memcalc-sample JBP_CONFIG_SAPJVM "[memory_calculator: {memory_heuristics: {heap: 85, stack: 10}}]"
    ```

-   Customize the memory sizes by using the JBP\_CONFIG\_SAPJVM\_MEMORY\_SIZES environment variable

    ```
    cf set-env myapp JBP_CONFIG_SAPJVM_MEMORY_SIZES 'heap:30m..400m,stack:2m..,metaspace:10m..12m'
    ```

-   Customize the memory weights by using the JBP\_CONFIG\_SAPJVM\_MEMORY\_WEIGHTS environment variable

    ```
    cf set-env myapp JBP_CONFIG_SAPJVM_MEMORY_WEIGHTS 'heap:5,stack:1,metaspace:3,native:1'
    ```

-   Customize the memory initials by using the JBP\_CONFIG\_SAPJVM\_MEMORY\_INITIALS environment variable

    ```
    cf set-env myapp JBP_CONFIG_SAPJVM_MEMORY_INITIALS "heap:50%,metaspace:50%"
    ```

## Algorithm

When given certain memory limit, the memory calculator will try to calculate memory sizes for *heap*, *metaspace*, *stack* and *native* in a way that satisfies the proportions configured with the *memory\_heuristics*. Then the calculator will validate and adjust those sizes against the configured *memory\_sizes*.

Let's say that the calculated value for *heap*, according to the *memory\_heuristics*, is 120M. Let's assume that the *memory\_sizes* configuration for heap is 10M..100M. Even though 120M goes beyond the configured range, according to *memory\_heuristics*, 120M could be allocated for heap and the chosen value for *heap* size would be 100M. The calculation goes on until sizes \(*heap*, *metaspace*, *stack*, and *native*\) are calculated for all of the regions. Finally, the *memory\_initials* will be respected. This would affect the values of `-Xms`, `-Xms`, `-XX:MetaspaceSize`, and `-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize`.



### Example 1 \(memory limit of 1G with default settings of the memory calculator\)

First, the algorithm will try to estimate the number of threads for the given *memory\_limit* and *memory\_heuristics* given 1M per thread. This way, we'll have `estimated_number_of_threads`=*\(\(5/100\)\*1024M\)* = *51.2M* space for *stack*. Considering 1M per thread \(which by default is the `-Xss` size of the SAP JVM\), we'll get `estimated_number_of_threads`=*51.2*

1.  Apply the configured `memory_heuristics`:

    -   *heap*: \(75/100\)\* 1024M = 768M

    -   *metaspace*: \(10/100\) \* 1024M = 104857K

    -   *stack*: \(5/100\) \* 1024M = 51.2M

    -   *native*: \(10/100\) \* 1024M = 104858K


2.  Apply the configured `memory_sizes`:

    There is a memory range defined for *metaspace*, which is 64.

    The value 104857K calculated in step1 for *metaspace* satisfies the range.

3.  Apply the `memory_initials`:

    -   *\-Xms*: 100% \* 768M = 768M

    -   *\-Xmx*: 768M

    -   *\-XX:MetaspaceSize*: 100% \* 104857K = 104857K

    -   *\-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize*: 104857K

    -   *\-Xss: stack* / estimated\_number\_of\_threads = 51.2M / 51.2 = 1M

First, the algorithm will try to estimate the number of threads for the given *memory\_limit* and *memory\_heuristics* given 1M per thread. This way, we'll have `estimated_number_of_threads`=*\(\(5/100\)\*1024M\)* = *51.2M* space for *stack*. Considering 1M per thread \(which by default is the `-Xss` size of the SAP JVM\), we'll get `estimated_number_of_threads`=*51.2*.

**Round 1:**

1.  Apply the configured `memory_heuristics`:

    -   *heap* = \(75/100\) \* 1024M = 768M

    -   *metaspace* = \(10/100\) \* 1024M = 104857K

    -   *stack* = \(5/100\) \* 1024M = 51.2M

    -   *native*: \(10/100\) \* 1024M = 104857K


2.  Apply the configured `memory_sizes`:

    The *metaspace* should be between 60m and 70m. Since the value calculated in step 1 goes beyond this range, the chosen value for *metaspace* becomes 70M. This leads to a second round of calculation since there are \(104857K - 70M\) = 33177K, which are available to be distributed among the other regions - heap, stack, native.


**Round 2:**

The *metaspace* is already calculated, so its size is substracted from the memory limit leading to memory available for distribution, which is \(1G - 70M\) = 954M.

The same calculation takes place, this time the *metaspace* is not considered because it's already calculated.

1.  Apply the `memory_heuristics`:

    -   *heap* = \(75/90\) \* 954M = 795M

    -   *stack* = \(5/90\) \* 954M = 53

    -   *native* = \(10/90\) \* 954M = 106M


2.  Apply the `memory_sizes`:

    No settings for *heap*, *stack* or *native*, thus no changes are needed in the calculations from step 1.

3.  Apply the `memory_initials`:

    -   *\-Xms*: 100% \* 795M = 795M

    -   *\-Xmx*: 795M

    -   *\-XX:MetaspaceSize*: 50% \* 70M = 35M

    -   *\-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize*: 70M

    -   *\-Xss*: stack / estimated\_number\_of\_threads = 53 / 51.2 = 1060K
