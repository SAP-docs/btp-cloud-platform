## 1. Generating and Deploying Your Application

> ### Prerequisites:  
> -   You have created a development package in ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse. See [Creating ABAP Packages](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-abap-development-user-guide/creating-abap-packages?version=Cloud).
> -   You have exposed a RAP business service as an OData service. See [Using Service Binding Editor for OData Service](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-cds-tools-user-guide/using-service-binding-editor-for-odata-v4-service?version=sap_btp). In case no suitable service is available yet, you may create one based on a released BO interface or CDS View. See[Develop an OData UI Service Against a Released BO Interface or CS View](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform-internal/develop-odata-ui-service-against-released-bo-interface-or-cds-view?version=Cloud).
> -   Business catalog `SAP_A4C_BC_DEV_UID_PC` is assigned to your user, which allows you to discover available services and deploy your application.
> -   Business catalog `SAP_CORE_BC_EXT_TST` is assigned to your user, which allows you to preview your application. See [Business Catalogs for Development Tasks](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-btp-abap-environment/abap-environment/business-catalogs-for-development-tasks?version=Cloud).
> -   You have an open transport request.

1.  As a developer user in SAP Business Application Studio, generate an SAP Fiori application. See [Generate an Application](https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/db44d45051794d778f1dd50def0fa267.html).
    1.  In the *Data Source and Service Selection* section of the Template Wizard, select the following values:

        -   Data source: *Connect to a System*.
        -   System:
            -   \(Option 1\) Select the destination that you have created for the SAP Business Application studio integration \(`SAP_Business_Application_Studio`\). See [Creating a Destination to the ABAP System for SAP Business Application Studio](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/creating-destination-to-abap-system-for-sap-business-application-studio?version=Cloud).
            -   \(Option 2\) Select *ABAP Environment on SAP Business Technology Platform*.

                From the ABAP environment drop-down menu, choose a service instance.

                > ### Note:  
                > You have to log on to your Cloud Foundry space by executing command `cf login` in the terminal or by navigating to *View* \> *Find Command* \> *CF: Login to Cloud Foundry*. When you're prompted to enter the API endpoint, org name, and space, you can navigate to your subaccount in the SAP BTP cockpit, where you can find this information.


        -   Continue with choosing a service.

    2.  Add a deployment configuration. See section *Add deployment configuration \> ABAP system* in [Additional Configuration](https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/9bea64e63b824261932d90037ce3c5ae.html).

        If you want to create your deployment configuration later, see [Generate Deployment Configuration ABAP](https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/c06b9cbb3f3641aabfe3a5d199e855a0.html).

    3.  Add an SAP Fiori launchpad configuration for your UI project. See section *Add FLP configuration* in [Additional Configuration](https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/9bea64e63b824261932d90037ce3c5ae.html).

        If you want to create you FLP configuration later, see [SAP Fiori Launchpad Configuration](https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/bc3cb890dbb84d51ae80394821ce4990.html).


2.  Continue with the development of the UI, for example, with the help of guided development. See [Implement Features using Guided Development](https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/0c9e518ecf704b2f80a2bed0eaca60ae.html).
3.  Now you can preview the generated SAP Fiori application. See [Preview an Application](https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/b962685bdf9246f6bced1d1cc1d9ba1c.html).
4.  Deploy the SAP Fiori UI by executing command `npm run deploy` in the terminal of your project. See [Deployment to ABAP](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/607014e278d941fda4440f92f4a324a6.html#deployment-to-abap).
5.  4. On top of these launchpad app descriptor items that are created automatically during app deployment, you may also create such objects manually in ABAP development tools for Eclipse. Refer to [Creating Launchpad App Descriptor Items](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-development-tools-user-guide/creating-launchpad-app-descriptor-items).

## 2. Creating and Publishing Your Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) App

> ### Prerequisite:  
> Business catalog `SAP_A4C_BC_DEV_PC` is assigned to your user, which is required for development with ABAP Development Tools. See [Business Catalogs for Development Tasks](../50-administration-and-ops/business-catalogs-for-development-tasks-a9f4278.md).

![](images/DevelopSAPFioriPic1_19a2ef5.png)

1.  To manage access to your SAP Fiori application, you need to log on as a developer in ABAP development tools for Eclipse to create an Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) application, assign a launchpad app descriptor item for your UI5 application and a service, and maintain authorizations \(steps 1-3 in the figure above\). See [Creating an IAM App for the Business Service](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/creating-iam-app-for-business-service?version=Cloud).
2.  Once you have created your IAM app, you have to create a business catalog. See [Creating a Business Catalog](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/iam-creating-business-catalog?version=Cloud).
3.  Assign your IAM app to the business catalog.
4.  Publish the IAM app and business catalog locally.
