> 
> As connection-specific header fields aren't supported by the HTTP/2 protocol \(see [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113)\), the application router removes such headers automatically when they are returned from a backend to prevent a failure of the HTTP/2 response.

</td>
</tr>
</table>



<a name="loioba527058dc4d423a9e0a69ecc67f4593__section_rhz_hgn_mv"/>

## httpHeaders

If configured, the application router sends additional HTTP headers in its responses to a client request. You can set the additional HTTP headers in the *<httpHeaders\>* environment variable. The following example configuration shows how to configure the application router to send two additional headers in the responses to the client requests from the application *<myApp\>*:

<code>cf set-env <i class="varname">&lt;myApp&gt;</i> httpHeaders "[ { \"X-Frame-Options\": \"ALLOW-FROM http://acme.com\" }, { \"Test-Additional-Header\": \"1\" } ]"</code>

or

<code>cf set-env <i class="varname">&lt;myApp&gt;</i> httpHeaders '[{ "X-Frame-Options": "ALLOW-FROM http://acme.com" }, { "Test-Additional-Header": "1" }]'</code>

> ### Tip:  
> To ensure better security of your application set the `Content-Security-Policy` header. This is a response header which informs browsers \(capable of interpreting it\) about the trusted sources from which an application expects to load resources. This mechanism allows the client to detect and block malicious scripts injected into the application. A value can be set via the *<httpHeaders\>* environment variable in the additional headers configuration. The value represents a security policy which contains directive-value pairs. The value of a directive is an allowlist of trusted sources.
> 
> Usage of the Content-Security-Policy header is considered second line of defense. An application should always provide proper input validation and output encoding.

## destinations

The destinations configuration is an array of objects that is defined in the `destinations` environment variable. A destination is required for every application \(microservice\) that is part of the business application. The following table lists the properties that can be used to describe the destination:

</td>
</tr>
</table>

If `true`, the certificates and key of the authentication service are added to the HTTP connection to the destination. The default value is `false`. For more information see: [Mutual TLS Authentication \(mTLS\) and Certificates Handling](mutual-tls-authentication-mtls-and-certificates-handling-46b8b85.md)

The following example shows a simple configuration for the *<destinations\>* environment variable:

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> [
>  {
>    "name" : "ui5",
>    "url" : "https://sapui5.acme.com",
>    "proxyHost" : "proxy",
>    "proxyPort" : "8080",
>    "forwardAuthToken" : false,
>    "timeout" : 1200
>  }
> ]
> ```

It is also possible to include the destinations in the `manifest.yml` file, as illustrated in the following example:

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> 
> - name: node-hello-world 
>   memory: 100M 
>   path: web 
>   env: destinations: > 
>        [
>         {"name":"ui5", "url":"https://sapui5.acme.com"} 
>        ]
> ```



<a name="loioba527058dc4d423a9e0a69ecc67f4593__section_gbt_1nc_4kb"/>

## Additional Cookie Attributes

If configured, the application router sends additional cookie attributes in its responses to the client. Additional cookies attributes can be set in the *<COOKIES\>* environment variable.

Example of configuration for cookies in the `manifest.yml`:

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> env:
>    COOKIES: >
>      {
>        "SameSite":"None",
>        "Partitioned":
>             {
>                "supportedPartitionAgents":"^Mozilla.*(Chrome|Chromium|)/((109)|(1[1-9][0-9])|([2-9][0-9][0-9]))",
>                "unsupportedPartitionAgents":"PostmanRuntime/7.29.2"
>             }
>      }
> 
> ```

In this example, the application router sets the `SameSite attribute` of the cookie to *None* and the specifies a `Partitioned` attribute that is sent in the responses to the client.

> ### Note:  
> Currently, only the values `None` and `Lax` are supported for the `SameSite` attribute. The value `Strict` is not supported.

The `Partitioned` attribute contains two required regular expressions:

-   `supportedPartitionAgents` for supported agents

-   `unsupportedPartitionAgents` for unsupported agents


You can use a wildcard '\(.\*\)' in supportedPartitionAgents to allow all agents to use the`Partitioned` attribute.

> ### Note:  
> `unsupportedPartionAgents` overwrites the configurations in `supportedPartitionAgents`. If an agent is allowed in`supportedPartitionAgents` but disallowed in `unsupportedPartitionAgents`, the`Partitioned` attribute will not be returned.



<a name="loioba527058dc4d423a9e0a69ecc67f4593__section_blz_hgn_mv"/>

## SESSION\_TIMEOUT

You can configure the triggering of an automatic central log-out from the User Account and Authentication \(UAA\) service if an application session is inactive for a specified time. A session is considered to be inactive if no requests are sent to the application router. The following command shows how to set the environment variable *<SESSION\_TIMEOUT\>* to 40 \(forty\) minutes for the application *<myApp1\>*:

<code>cf set-env <i class="varname">&lt;myApp1&gt;</i> SESSION_TIMEOUT 40</code>

> ### Note:  
> You can also set the session timeout value in the application's `manifest.yml` file, as illustrated in the following example:

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> - name: myApp1 
>   memory: 100M
>   path: web
>   env:
>     SESSION_TIMEOUT: 40
> ```

> ### Tip:  
> If the authentication type for a route is set to `"xsuaa"` \(for example, `"authenticationType": "xsuaa"`\), the application router depends on the UAA server for user authentication, and the UAA server might have its own session timeout defined. To avoid problems caused by unexpected timeouts, it is recommended that the session timeout values configured for the application router and the UAA are identical."



<a name="loioba527058dc4d423a9e0a69ecc67f4593__section_d4z_hgn_mv"/>

## SEND\_XFRAMEOPTIONS

By default, the application router sends the `X-Frame-Options` header with the value “`SAMEORIGIN`”. You can change this behavior either by disabling the sending of the default header value \(for example, by setting SEND\_XFRAMEOPTIONS environment variable to false\) or by overriding the value, for example, by configuring additional headers \(with the *<httpHeaders\>* environment variable\).

The following example shows how to disable the sending of the `X-Frame-Options` for a specific application, `myApp1`:

<code>cf set-env <i class="varname">&lt;myApp1&gt;</i> SEND_XFRAMEOPTIONS false</code>



<a name="loioba527058dc4d423a9e0a69ecc67f4593__section_nrz_hgn_mv"/>

## CJ\_PROTECT\_WHITELIST

The *<CJ\_PROTECT\_WHITELIST\>* specifies a list of origins \(for example, host or domain names\) that do not need to be protected against click-jacking attacks. This list of allowed host names and domains are used by the application router's allowlist service to protect XS advanced applications against click-jacking attacks. When an HTML page needs to be rendered in a frame, a check is done by calling the allowlist service to validate if the parent frame is allowed to render the requested content in a frame. The check itself is provided by the allowlist service

The following example shows how to add a host name to the click-jacking protection allowlist for the application, `myApp1`:

<code>cf set-env <i class="varname">&lt;myApp1&gt;</i> CJ_PROTECT_WHITELIST {<i class="varname">&lt;protocol&gt;</i>, <i class="varname">&lt;hostname&gt;</i>, <i class="varname">&lt;portNr&gt;</i>}</code>

The content is a JSON list of objects with the properties listed in the following table:

<a name="loioba527058dc4d423a9e0a69ecc67f4593__section_ijs_5fm_4v"/>

## WS\_ALLOWED\_ORIGINS

When the application router receives an upgrade request, it verifies that the `origin` header includes the URL of the application router. If this is not the case, then an HTTP response with status 403 is returned to the client. This origin verification can be further configured with the environment variable *<WS\_ALLOWED\_ORIGINS\>*, which defines a list of the allowed origins the application router uses in the verification process.

> ### Note:  
> The structure of the *<WS\_ALLOWED\_ORIGINS\>* variable is the same as the variable *<CJ\_PROTECT\_WHITELIST\>*.

<code>cf set-env <i class="varname">&lt;myApp1&gt;</i> WS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS</code> \{*<\*.acme.com\>*\}



<a name="loioba527058dc4d423a9e0a69ecc67f4593__section_x5z_hgn_mv"/>

## JWT\_REFRESH

The `JWT_REFRESH` environment variable is used to configure the application router to refresh a JSON Web Token \(JWT\) for an application, by default, 5 minutes before the JWT expires, if the session is active.

<code>cf set-env <i class="varname">&lt;myApp1&gt;</i> JWT_REFRESH 1</code>

If the JWT is close to expiration and the session is still active, a JWT refresh will be triggered *<JWT\_REFRESH\>* minutes before expiration. The default value is 5 minutes. To disable the automatic refresh, set the value of *<JWT\_REFRESH\>* to 0 \(zero\).



<a name="loioba527058dc4d423a9e0a69ecc67f4593__section_wf1_lgn_mv"/>

## UAA\_SERVICE\_NAME

The `UAA_SERVICE_NAME` environment variable enables you to configure an instance of the User Account and Authorization service for a specific application, as illustrated in the following example:

<code>cf set-env <i class="varname">&lt;myApp1&gt;</i> UAA_SERVICE_NAME <i class="varname">&lt;myUAAServiceName&gt;</i></code>

> ### Note:  
> The details of the service configuration are defined in the *<VCAP\_SERVICES\>* environment variable, which is not configured by the user.



<a name="loioba527058dc4d423a9e0a69ecc67f4593__section_owp_xch_wx"/>

## INCOMING\_CONNECTION\_TIMEOUT

The `INCOMING_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` environment variable enables you to set the maximum time \(in milliseconds\) allowed for a client connection, as illustrated in the following example:

<code>cf set-env <i class="varname">&lt;myApp1&gt;</i> INCOMING_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT 60000</code>

If the specified time is exceeded, the connection is closed. If `INCOMING_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` is set to zero \(0\), the connection-timeout feature is disabled. The default value for `INCOMING_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` is 120000 ms \(2 min\).



<a name="loioba527058dc4d423a9e0a69ecc67f4593__section_zhq_xch_wx"/>

## TENANT\_HOST\_PATTERN

The `TENANT_HOST_PATTERN` environment variable enables you to specify a string containing a regular expression with a capturing group. The requested host is matched against this regular expression. The value of the first capturing group is used as the tenant Id. as illustrated in the following example:

<code>cf set-env <i class="varname">&lt;myApp1&gt;</i> TENANT_HOST_PATTERN</code>



<a name="loioba527058dc4d423a9e0a69ecc67f4593__section_vsq_xch_wx"/>

## COMPRESSION

The `COMPRESSION` environment variable enables you to configure the compression of resources before a response to the client, as illustrated in the following example:

<code>cf set-env <i class="varname">&lt;myApp1&gt;</i> COMPRESSION</code>

Here is a complete example of the compression environment variable:

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
>  env:
>    COMPRESSION: >
>         { 
> 	  "enabled": true,
> 	  "minSize": 2048,
> 	  "compressResponseMixedTypeContent": true
> 	  }
> ```



<a name="loioba527058dc4d423a9e0a69ecc67f4593__section_wpy_yfg_2z"/>

## SECURE\_SESSION\_COOKIE

The `SECURE_SESSION_COOKIE` can be set to *true* or *false*. By default, the `Secure` flag of the session cookie is set depending on the environment the application router runs in. For example, when the application router is running behind a router that is configured to serve HTTPS traffic, then this flag will be present. During local development the flag is not set.

> ### Note:  
> If the `Secure` flag is enforced, the application router will reject requests sent over unencrypted connections.

The following example illustrates how to set the `SECURE_SESSION_COOKIE` environment variable:

<code>cf set-env <i class="varname">&lt;myApp1&gt;</i> SECURE_SESSION_COOKIE true</code>

## REQUEST\_TRACE

You can enable additional traces of the incoming and outgoing requests by setting the environment variable *<REQUEST\_TRACE\>*“`true`”. If enabled, basic information is logged for every incoming and outgoing request to the application router.

The following example illustrates how to set the `REQUEST_TRACE` environment variable:

<code>cf set-env <i class="varname">&lt;myApp1&gt;</i> REQUEST_TRACE true</code>

> ### Tip:  
> This is in addition to the information generated by the Node.js package `@sap/logging` that is used by the XS advanced application router.

## CORS

The `CORS` environment variable enables you to provide support for cross-origin requests, for example, by allowing the modification of the request header. Cross-origin resource sharing \(CORS\) permits Web pages from other domains to make HTTP requests to your application domain, where normally such requests would automatically be refused by the Web browser's security policy.

Cross-origin resource sharing \(CORS\) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a Web page to be requested from another domain \(protocol and port\) outside the domain \(protocol and port\) from which the first resource was served. The CORS configuration enables you to define details to control access to your application resource from other Web browsers. For example, you can specify where requests can originate from or what is allowed in the request and response headers. The following example illustrates a basic CORS configuration:

```
[
  {
      "uriPattern": "^\route1$",
      "allowedMethods": [
        "GET"
      ],
      "allowedOrigin": [
        {
          "host": "host.acme.com",
          "protocol": "https",
          "port": 345
        }
      ],
      "maxAge": 3600,
      "allowedHeaders": [
        "Authorization",
        "Content-Type"
      ],
      "exposeHeaders": [
        "customHeader1",
        "customHeader2"
      ],
      "allowedCredentials": true
    }
]
```

The CORS configuration includes an array of objects with the following properties, some of which are mandatory:

It is also possible to include the CORS configuration in either the `manifest.yml` or the `manifest-op.yml` file. The code in the following example enables the CORS configuration for any route with a source URI pattern that matches the RegExp “`^\route1$`”:

> ### Sample Code:  
> CORS Configuration in the `manifest.yml` File
> 
> ```
> - name: node-hello-world
>   memory: 100M
>   path: web
>   env:
>     CORS: >
>       [
>         {
>           "allowedOrigin":[
>                             {

>                                 "protocol":"https"
>                             }
>                           ],
>           "uriPattern":"^/route1$"
>         }
> ```

## DIRECT\_ROUTING\_URI\_PATTERNS

With the direct routing URI patterns configuration, you can define a list of URIs that are directed to the routing configuration file \(xs-app.json file\) of the application router instead of to a specific application's xs-app.json file that is stored in the HTML5 Application Repository. This configuration improves the application loading time and monitoring options because it prevents unnecessary calls to the HTML5 Application Repository.

The configuration is an array of strings or regular expressions. You have to provide only the first segment in the URL, after the approuter host. For example, for the URL `https://<approuter-host>/route1/index.html`, you enter `route1` in the direct routing URI patterns array.

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> 
>  env:
>     DIRECT_ROUTING_URI_PATTERNS: >
>       ["route1", "^route2$", "route3"]
> ```



<a name="loioba527058dc4d423a9e0a69ecc67f4593__CF_NODEJS_LOGGING_LEVEL"/>

## `CF_NODEJS_LOGGING_LEVEL`

With the `CF_NODEJS_LOGGING_LEVEL` variable, you can set the minimal logging level of the c`f-nodejs-logging-support` library of the application router. The following levels are available:

-   `off`

-   `error`

-   `warn`

-   `info`

-   `verbose`

-   `debug`

-   `silly`


The default value is `error`.

Here is a sample content for the `CF_NODEJS_LOGGING_LEVEL` environment variable:

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> env:
>     CF_NODEJS_LOGGING_LEVEL: "debug"
> ```

> ### Note:  
> The application router also uses the `@sap/logging` library. To configure the log level for this library, you use the `XS_APP_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.
