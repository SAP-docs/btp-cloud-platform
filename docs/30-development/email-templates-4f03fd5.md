# Email Templates

An email template is a development object that contains HTML or text content.

These templates can be populated with placeholders during the creation process, using the backend editor in the ABAP development tools for Eclipse. These placeholders are replaced with actual content during runtime when emails are sent out using the template. This allows for the mass sending of emails containing different, recipient-specific data.

The creation of these templates is only possible in the ADT editor. Each email template is of type `predefined templates`, which means they have been created as a development object and are transportable. They can be used for rendering emails as soon as they've been activated.
