# Manage Gen AI Scenarios

After communication system and communication arrangement are configured, create an intelligent scenario and continue managing the lifecycle of the intelligent scenario. You are required to create an intelligent scenario for your custom owned Gen AI use cases.

With this intelligent scenario you can perform all lifecycle management operations to get an inference result. You can perform all the operations using the *Intelligent Scenario Management* app. You can also choose to automate all the operations by using turnkey feature. Once turnkey is enabled for an intelligent scenario, all the operations from pre-requisites check to activation are run automatically. Or, you can perform all these operations manually too.

The following is a list of operations that you can perform on an intelligent scenario:

-   Create - You can create an intelligent scenario of type Gen AI in ABAP development tools for Eclipse. See, [Creating Intelligent Scenarios](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-development-tools-user-guide/creating-intelligent-scenarios) and [Creating Intelligent Scenario Models](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-development-tools-user-guide/creating-intelligent-scenario-models) 
-   Deployment: You can deploy the trained machine learning models for inference consumption. This functionality applies to Side-by-Side scenarios only. See, [Deploy and Undeploy](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/a630d57fc5004c6383e7a81efee7a8bb/45383330c0bc43c88a5db235c45e9c22.html)

-   Activation: You can activate the trained machine learning model for which you want to get the inference results. See, [Activate and Deactivate](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/a630d57fc5004c6383e7a81efee7a8bb/8fe94c6e82f24b49917fa3b383737c13.html)

-   Inference Results - You can get the predictions that are generated from the trained machine learning models. See, [Inference Request](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/a630d57fc5004c6383e7a81efee7a8bb/a7efd535fb624a0bb5bf9f1855af2e9c.html)

-   Turnkey - You can automate all ML operations of an intelligent scenario. Which means, once turnkey is enabled for an intelligent scenario, all the operations, such as pre-requisites check, train, deployment, and activation are run automatically. See, [Turnkey](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/a630d57fc5004c6383e7a81efee7a8bb/5c40d9d7707346ea89fdc335f3a703f2.html)
