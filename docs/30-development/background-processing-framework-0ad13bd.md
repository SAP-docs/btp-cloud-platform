# Background Processing Framework

The background processing framework \(bgPF\) is a framework that asynchronously and reliably executes methods of applications that develop background processes.

The background processing framework \(bgPF\) is designed to execute methods of applications that develop background processes asynchronously and reliably. It is beneficial in applications that require time-consuming processes, enabling users to continue with other tasks while bgPF handles the processes in the background. bgPF is built on the background remote function call \(bgRFC\). It supports both transactional and queued background processes. In conjunction with the ABAP RESTful Programming Model \(RAP\), bgPF provides transactional control to maintain data consistency. The framework offers several advantages, including transactional consistency and integration with various ABAP tools. It is part of the standard functionality in ABAP Cloud and supports easy code testing.
