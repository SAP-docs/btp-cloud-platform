# Turnkey

The turnkey feature enables you to automate all end-to-end lifecycle operations of an intelligent scenario. Which means, once turnkey is enabled for an intelligent scenario, all the operations, such as pre-requisites check, train, deployment, and activation are run automatically. By automating these operations, turnkey feature significantly reduces manual effort during the initial activation of a scenario and throughout its lifecycle management. You can schedule turnkey and monitor the schedule in the *Turnkey* tab. Further details are about the schedule and runs are provided in the *Turnkey Schedule* and *Turnkey Runs* tabs.

You can select the intelligent scenario that supports the turnkey and switch it on. Once switched on, you can continue with the predefined schedule for turnkey. Else, modify the schedule details and create a new turnkey schedule as needed.

Before using the turnkey option, review the following conditions:

-   **Side-by-Side**:

    -   Undeploys already deployed deployments. Another deployment may be deployed

    -   Deactivates already activated deployment. Another deployment may be activated.


-   An admin can override the deployment and activation triggered by the turnkey.
