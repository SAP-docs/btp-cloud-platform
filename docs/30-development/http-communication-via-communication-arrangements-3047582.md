# HTTP Communication via Communication Arrangements

HTTP outbound communication can be established using so-called communication arrangements.



<a name="loio3047582e5c744bd9839a98c99bd224fa__section_c5x_3vx_qsb"/>

## Prerequisites

You've created a communication scenario as described in [Defining a Communication Scenario Including Authorization Values](defining-a-communication-scenario-including-authorization-values-bba0fd2.md).



<a name="loio3047582e5c744bd9839a98c99bd224fa__section_igc_wvx_qsb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Create a corresponding outbound service of type HTTP.

    1.  In your ABAP project, select the relevant package node in the Project Explorer.

    2.  Open the context menu and choose *File* \> *New* \> *Other ABAP Repository Object* \> *Cloud Communication Management* \> *Outbound Service* \> *Next*.
    3.  Enter the name of the outbound service.
    4.  Select *HTTP Service* in the *Service Type* dropdown list.
    5.  Choose *Next* and select a transport request.
    6.  Optional: Go to your outbound service and enter the URL in the field *Default Path Prefix*.
    7.  Save the outbound service.

2.  Add the newly created outbound service to your scenario.
3.  Publish the communication scenario. The administrator can then create the required communication management objects as described in [Test Your Outbound Call](http-communication-via-communication-arrangements-3047582.md#loio3047582e5c744bd9839a98c99bd224fa__section_tgg_1xx_qsb).
4.  Adapt the communication arrangement call according to your needs as described in the example. See [Service Consumption via Communication Arrangements](service-consumption-via-communication-arrangements-86aece6.md) for more information. According to your developed communication scenario, add the following:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    `comm_scenario`
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    mandatory
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    ID of the developed communication scenario.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    `comm_system_id`
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    optional
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    ID of the configured communication system. Use method `query_ca` of class`cl_com_arrangement_factory` to derive it dynamically.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    `service_id`
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    optional
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    ID of the developed outbound service.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    

> ### Note:  
> You can't use the `create_by_comm_arrangement` method for SAP-delivered scenarios.



## Example

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```abap
> DATA: lr_cscn type if_com_scenario_factory=>ty_query-cscn_id_range.
>  
> " find CA by scenario
>     lr_cscn = value #( ( sign = 'I' option = 'EQ' low = '<Scenario ID>' ) ).
>     DATA(lo_factory) = cl_com_arrangement_factory=>create_instance( ).
>     lo_factory->query_ca(
>       EXPORTING
>         is_query           = value #( cscn_id_range = lr_cscn )
>       IMPORTING
>         et_com_arrangement = data(lt_ca) ).
>  
>     IF lt_ca is initial.
>       EXIT.
>     ENDIF.
>  
> " take the first one
>     READ TABLE lt_ca INTO DATA(lo_ca) INDEX 1.
>  
> " get destination based to Communication Arrangement
>     TRY.
>         DATA(lo_dest) = cl_http_destination_provider=>create_by_comm_arrangement(
>             comm_scenario  = '<Scenario ID>'
>             service_id     = '<Outbound Service ID>'
>             comm_system_id = lo_ca->get_comm_system_id( ) ).
>                     
>         DATA(lo_http_client) = cl_web_http_client_manager=>create_by_http_destination( lo_dest ).
>          
> " execute the request        
>         DATA(lo_request) = lo_http_client->get_http_request( ).      
>         DATA(lo_response) = lo_http_client->execute( if_web_http_client=>get ).
>          
>       CATCH cx_http_dest_provider_error.
>         " handle exception here
>          
>       CATCH cx_web_http_client_error.
>         " handle exception here
>     ENDTRY.
> ```

> ### Note:  
> We recommend to retrieve the correct destination reference based on the communication scenario and a customer-defined property as described in [Service Consumption via Communication Arrangements](service-consumption-via-communication-arrangements-86aece6.md).

## Test Your Outbound Call

To test your outbound call, you have to provide a configuration for the outbound service you want to call in your code.

Create a communication system and communication arrangement for the communication scenario and maintain the required data, such as host name and credentials in the Communication Systems and Communication Arrangements apps.

These tasks are performed by the administrator. For more information, see [Set Up HTTP Communication](set-up-http-communication-3884bc3.md).
