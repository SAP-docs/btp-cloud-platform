### Overview

The diagram below shows how the service plans listed in the [SAP Discovery Center](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/cloud-foundry-runtime?region=all&tab=service_plan) correspond to the plans you choose in the SAP BTP cockpit, depending on the commercial model of your enterprise global account. For more information about the commercial models offered by SAP, see [Commercial Models](commercial-models-263d400.md).

This image is interactive. Hover over rectangles in the diagram to see the description. Choose the highlighted areas for more information.

The plans `standard` and `MEMORY` are used together to allow you to deploy and run applications in the Cloud Foundry environment.

-   `standard`: this plan allows you to create a Cloud Foundry org in a subaccount. **By itself**, the action of creating a Cloud Foundry org is free. However, when you run applications in it, you pay for the runtime memory that they use.

-   `MEMORY`: this plan is used to assign runtime memory quota to a subaccount. The runtime memory can then be consumed by applications that run in the Cloud Foundry org created with the plan `standard`. The usage of runtime memory by applications is **billable** according to the commercial model of your enterprise global account.

In the consumption-based commercial model, a default runtime memory quota of 200 GB is automatically assigned to all subaccounts, and the billing is based on the actual runtime memory usage. For more information, see [Service Specifics](service-plans-and-metering-for-cloud-foundry-runtime-8d41fa4.md#loio8d41fa40e47b45bf90d38e393a989c4c__service_specifics).

For information on how to set up the plan, see [Standard Plan for Cloud Foundry Runtime (Consumption-Based)](https://help.sap.com/viewer/4287333baaa6413a8ece0a8ed1196af4/Cloud/en-US/16a6f68b98074b93a4f331e576f2d955.html "Learn how to set up the standard plan for SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime in the consumption-based commercial model.") :arrow_upper_right:.

## Service Specifics

In the context of SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime, the terms **consumption** \(or **consume**\) and **usage** \(or **use**\) refer to the runtime memory quota **reserved** by the platform for each application instance. This quota serves as the basis for calculating the billable consumption, as explained in [Consumption Monitoring](https://help.sap.com/docs/cf-runtime/cloud-foundry-runtime/monitoring-and-troubleshooting?version=Cloud#consumption-monitoring).

> ### Caution:  
> From a billing standpoint, it doesn't matter how much of the reserved runtime memory quota is utilized when the application is running. Billable consumption is calculated based on the full amount of runtime memory reserved, regardless of how much runtime memory actually gets utilized.

> ### Note:  
> If an application is stopped, it doesn't reserve any runtime memory and, therefore, doesn't contribute to runtime memory consumption.

There are two application settings that define how much runtime memory an application uses at any given time:

-   Runtime memory quota reserved for each application instance \(default: 1024 MB\)

-   Number of running application instances \(default: 1\)


> ### Note:  
> The total amount of runtime memory that an application uses when all of its instances are running is displayed on the application's *Overview* page under *All Instances Memory*.

You can specify custom values for these settings when deploying an application in the Cloud Foundry environment. You can also change them for an application that has already been deployed without having to redeploy it.



### How to set runtime memory quota and number of instances when deploying applications

-   **Option 1:** Create a manifest YAML file and specify the following application attributes:

    -   <code><a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest-attributes.html#memory">memory</a></code>: runtime memory quota per application instance
    -   <code><a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest-attributes.html#instances">instances</a></code>: number of application instances

    For more information about the manifest formatting, see [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest-attributes.html](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest-attributes.html).

    You can then deploy your application with the manifest in one of two ways:

    -   Using the SAP BTP cockpit: [Deploy an Application](../50-administration-and-ops/deploy-an-application-09fdb9b.md)
    -   Using the Cloud Foundry CLI: [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html)

-   **Option 2:** In the SAP BTP cockpit, choose *Deploy Application*, select *Custom Settings* and specify the following:

    -   *Memory per Instance \(MB\)*: runtime memory quota per application instance
    -   *Number of Instances*: number of application instances

    For more information about the procedure, see [Deploy an Application](../50-administration-and-ops/deploy-an-application-09fdb9b.md).

-   **Option 3:** In the Cloud Foundry CLI, use the command `cf push` with the following flags:

    -   `-m`: runtime memory quota per application instance
    -   `-i`: number of application instances

    For more information about the procedure, see [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html\#custom-push](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html#custom-push).




### How to change runtime memory quota and number of instances for already deployed applications

-   **Option 1:** In the SAP BTP cockpit, on the *Overview* page of the application you can:

    -   Change the runtime memory quota per application instance under *Change Instance Details* \> *Memory per Instance \(MB\)*
    -   Change the number of application instances as described in [Manage Application Instances](../50-administration-and-ops/manage-application-instances-75836f1.md)

-   **Option 2:** In the Cloud Foundry CLI, you can use the command `cf scale` with the following flags:

    -   `-m`: change the runtime memory quota per application instance
    -   `-i`: change the number of application instances

    For more information about the procedure, see [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/cf-scale.html](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/cf-scale.html).


You can use the **Application Autoscaler** to automatically increase or decrease the number of application instances based on the policies you have defined. For more information, see [What Is Application Autoscaler](https://help.sap.com/viewer/7472b7d13d5d4862b2b06a730a2df086/Cloud/en-US/45341f37cf6e4738a4b7cd20f18350de.html "Automatically scale your applications to meet their dynamic resource needs.") :arrow_upper_right:.

> ### Tip:  
> For tips on how to optimize the consumption of runtime memory, see the blog post [Optimise your SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime costs](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/11/optimise-your-sap-btp-cloud-foundry-runtime-costs/). Note that while the general principles outlined in the blog post still apply, some of the UI texts and parameter names may have changed.
