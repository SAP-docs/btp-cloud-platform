## What is Kyma CLI

With a single command, you can push a simple application to a Kyma cluster. Kyma CLI builds the container image from source code or Dockerfile, pushes it to the in-cluster registry, and applies the necessary Kubernetes resources, eliminating the manual setup process and accelerating your development.

Kyma CLI provides a hands-on experience when interacting with Kymaâ€™s extensions to Kubernetes API, making it easier to explore, test, and fine-tune Kyma's custom resources directly from the command line.

Kyma CLI also provides a set of commands to manage Kyma modules efficiently. You can manage, deploy, and configure modules seamlessly. With the Kyma CLI module commands, you can list available and installed modules, and add or delete them. Modules can be deployed with the default or custom configuration.
