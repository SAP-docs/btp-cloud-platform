# Kyma Dashboard

Use Kyma dashboard to access various features and functionalities of SAP BTP, Kyma runtime.

Kyma dashboard is a web-based UI utilizing the React library and the SAP Fiori Horizon design system. Kyma uses Kyma dashboard as a central administration dashboard, which provides a graphical overview of your cluster and all its resources.

To access Kyma dashboard, enable Kyma in your subaccount. The link to the dashboard will be visible in the **Kyma Environment** section.
