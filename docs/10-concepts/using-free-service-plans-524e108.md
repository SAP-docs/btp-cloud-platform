# Using Free Service Plans

The free tier model for SAP BTP lets you try out services in global accounts without any additional cost using the consumption-based commercial model and an [enterprise account](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/enterprise-accounts?version=Cloud).



We offer free service plans for many services within SAP BTP. Free service plans are limited in scope and capacity. They are designed to allow you and your team to explore new SAP BTP capabilities before committing to subscribing to a full capacity paid service.

The free tier model for SAP BTP is added automatically to new and existing contracts using the consumption-based commercial model. There, the free service plans are visible.

> ### Note:  
> The use of the consumption-based commercial model is subject to its availability in your country or region.

The consumption-based commercial model is available in the following flavors: the **SAP BTPEA** \(SAP BTP Enterprise Agreement\), the **CPEA** \(**Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement**\) and **Pay-As-You-Go for SAP BTP**. For more information, see [What Is the Consumption-Based Commercial Model?](what-is-the-consumption-based-commercial-model-7047eb4.md).

To try out services that participate in the free tier model for SAP BTP, create a service instance using the **Free** service plan offered by the service.

> ### Tip:  
> To find out which services offer the free plans, see [Discover Free Services](using-free-service-plans-524e108.md#loio524e1081d8dc4b0f9d055a6bec383ec3__Find-FreeServices). Here, you also find information on how to identify the technical limitations of the free plan of each service. [Access Free Services](using-free-service-plans-524e108.md#loio524e1081d8dc4b0f9d055a6bec383ec3__Access-FreeServices) by assigning entitlements to subaccounts and creating service instances.

Once you reach the technical limits of a service and want to continue using it, you must move to a paid service plan. Upgrading an existing service instance from free tier to paid usually doesn't require creating a new service instance. Find out how to upgrade a service plan at [Upgrade to a Paid Service Plan](using-free-service-plans-524e108.md#loio524e1081d8dc4b0f9d055a6bec383ec3__Upgrade-FreeServices).

Use of free tier service plans is subject to additional terms and conditions as provided in the [Business Technology Platform Supplemental Terms and Conditions](https://www.sap.com/about/trust-center/agreements/cloud/cloud-services.html?tag=language:english&search=Supplement%20Business%20Technology%20Platform&sort=latest_desc) Only community support is available for Free service plans and these aren't subject to SLAs.

## Update to a Paid Service Plan

Once you've reached the limits of the free plan, you can upgrade the free service plan to a paid plan.

> ### Note:  
> The option to upgrade from free tier service plans to paid service plans is not yet available for all services and runtimes, such as Kyma. To use a paid service plan for Kyma runtime, you will need a new Kyma cluster. It is possible to have both - free and paid clusters - in parallel.

> ### Note:  
> To update the ABAP environment to a paid service plan, you first need to configure entitlements and quotas for the ABAP environment. You need at least the following entitlements assigned to your subaccount:
> 
> -   service plan: *standard* or build-runtime \(service ABAP Environment\)
> 
> -   quota plans:
> 
>     -   *1 abap\_compute\_unit*
> 
>     -   *2 hana\_compute\_unit*
> 
> 
> 
> For more information, see [Increasing the Quota for the ABAP Environment](../20-getting-started/increasing-the-quota-for-the-abap-environment-c40cb18.md).

> ### Note:  
> It's not possible to switch from a paid plan to a free plan.
