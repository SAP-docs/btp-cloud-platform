# Continuous Integration and Delivery \(CI/CD\)

Configure and run predefined continuous integration and delivery \(CI/CD\) pipelines that automatically build, test, and deploy your code changes to speed up your development and delivery cycles.

> ### Note:  
> For links to all SAP solutions for CI/CD, blog posts, presentations, and tutorials, have a look at our [Continuous Integration and Delivery by SAP](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/CICD_OVERVIEW/Cloud/en-US?task=discover_task) overview.

**Continuous integration \(CI\)** describes a software development process, in which various team members integrate their contributions frequently into a single main line. Before each integration, the changes are verified through builds and automated testing. Thereby, you can detect errors as quickly as possible and prevent integration problems before completing the development.

The **continuous delivery \(CD\)** concept expands on the one of continuous integration. It adds the aspect that any change that has successfully passed the tests is immediately ready to be deployed to production, both from a technical and a qualitative point of view.

The following graphic shows the basic flow for continuous integration and delivery:

## Get Started with CI/CD

SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery provides an easy, UI-guided way to set up the service and configure and run your pipelines, without hosting your own Jenkins instance.

To set up SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery:

1.  Enable the service in the SAP BTP cockpit.
2.  Assign either the *Administrator* or *Developer* role to your user.
3.  Enable the API usage to connect SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery to other services, if necessary.

To configure SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery:

> ### Note:  
> Only administrators of SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery can configure the service.

1.  Configure credentials for connecting SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery to other services \(for example, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Server, or Azure Repos to clone your sources, and SAP BTP to deploy your built application\).

2.  Add your repository.


Now you can create and modify your CI/CD jobs and monitor their outcome. If you want to automate your builds, you can configure a webhook between your repository and the service. You can create and modify timed triggers for your jobs, if necessary.

For more information, see [Initial Setup](https://help.sap.com/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery/sap-continuous-integration-and-delivery/initial-setup?version=Cloud) and [Configuration](https://help.sap.com/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery/sap-continuous-integration-and-delivery/configuration?version=Cloud).

## Automate the Provisioning of Resources Needed to Create a Kyma Cluster

Integrate the Terraform module, which uses the Terraform provider for SAP BTP, into CI/CD pipelines, so you can automate the provisioning of resources needed to create a Kyma cluster, deploy applications, run tests, and tear down the resources when they are no longer required. As there is no need to have resources running continuously, this approach reduces operational costs.

See [Terraforming Kyma Runtimes](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-developers-guide-dev/btp-developers-guide?version=Cloud).
