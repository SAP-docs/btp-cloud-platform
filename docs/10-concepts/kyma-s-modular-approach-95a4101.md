# Kyma's Modular Approach

With Kyma's modular approach, you can install only the modules you need, instead of a predefined set of components.

## Kyma Module or Component?

Classic Kyma runtime offered a fixed set of mandatory interdependent components whose development rhythm was synchronized and determined by the release schedule. One by one, all Kyma components are converted to modules that work independently from each other.

The modular approach boosts Kyma's extensibility and scalability and makes it more cost-effective. With fully modularized Kyma, you can choose from many of its modules to facilitate your business needs best.  You can add or delete modules on demand and configure them, thus determining the costs generated by the infrastructure that your modules use.

You can decide which modules are needed for your workload, although some features may still require the presence of other modules or related capabilities. For example, the API Gateway module depends on Istio capabilities, but it doesn't require the Istio module from Kyma. Instead, the API Gateway module needs Istio custom resources, such as Gateway and VirtualService, to be present in the cluster. If you want to use your own Istio installation, the API Gateway module will use it as soon as the required resources are available.

## Kyma Release Channels

Sets of Kyma modules are deployed in two release channels:

-   *Regular channel* is the default release channel.

-   *Fast channel* provides more frequent releases. It offers early previews of all new features and changes before they are promoted to the regular channel. It also allows you to test and provide feedback on the new features sooner.


You can use one or both release channels in your Kyma cluster, but you can define only one release channel per module. For example, you can mix different modules from the regular and fast channels in your development cluster, but you cannot deploy the same module in the regular and fast versions in one cluster.

> ### Note:  
> You can upgrade module versions, but you cannot downgrade them. To test the upstream versions, you can switch a module or an entire cluster from the regular channel to the fast one. To return to the regular channel, switch back to it, and wait until the upgrade is automatically applied in your cluster. Alternatively, you can delete and add your module from the regular channel.

To find out which module version is running on your cluster, go to [Kyma dashboard](https://dashboard.kyma.cloud.sap/clusters).

## Release Notes

A release of a new module’s version is announced with a release note in [What’s New for SAP Business Technology Platform](https://help.sap.com/whats-new/cf0cb2cb149647329b5d02aa96303f56?locale=en-US&version=Cloud) for both, the fast and regular channels. On the day of the release in the fast channel, a release note is published with the `preview` label. The `preview` label is removed after approximately two weeks when the module version becomes available in the regular channel.
