-   To see all navigation options and the resources' aliases, enter the question mark sign `(?)`. For example, if you want to see your namespaces, it's enough to type `ns`.

-   Switch contexts between your resources. For example, if you're viewing your available Pods in the `default` namespace, and you want to check the Pods in a different one, type `ns/{NAME_OF_YOUR_NAMESPACE}` and choose the `Switch Context` option. It takes you to the list of Pods in the selected namespace.
