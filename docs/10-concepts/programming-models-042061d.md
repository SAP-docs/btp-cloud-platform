## ABAP Cloud

ABAP Cloud reflects the modern way to develop ABAP. It allows you to build lifecycle-stable and cloud-ready business applications, services, and extensions.

ABAP Cloud provides tools and techniques that ensure cloud qualities, promotes new technologies, contains a cloud-optimized subset of the ABAP language, and makes upgrade cycles easier by a clear separation between custom code and SAP code by only using released APIs and objects.

## SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\)

The SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\) is a framework of languages, libraries, and tools for building enterprise-grade services and applications. It supports Java \(with Spring Boot\), JavaScript, and TypeScript \(with Node.js\), which are some of the most widely adopted languages. CAP guides developers along a path of proven best practices and a great wealth of out-of-the-box solutions to recurring tasks.

CAP-based projects benefit from a primary focus on the domain. Instead of delving into overly technical disciplines, CAP focuses on accelerated development and safeguarding investments in a world of rapidly changing cloud technologies.

Here are some of the benefits that come with the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\):

-   Built-in best practices

-   Support for Visual Studio Code and SAP Business Application Studio tools

-   Safeguarded application development investments

-   No runtimes lock-in

-   Reuse and integration of SAP BTP application services

-   Latest UX and themes
