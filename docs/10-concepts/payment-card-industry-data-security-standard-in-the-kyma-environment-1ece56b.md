# Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard in the Kyma Environment

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard \(PCI DSS\) ensures businesses protect cardholder data, and SAP BTP Kyma runtime's compliance attestation confirms its security measures.

[PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/standards/pci-dss/) is a set of rules and requirements for businesses that store, process, or transmit payment card information, designed to protect cardholder data from fraud. SAP BTP, Kyma runtime holds the PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance \(AoC\) v4.0.1. The AoC defines how Kyma is compliant with the PCI standard.
