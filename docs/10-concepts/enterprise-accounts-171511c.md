# Enterprise Accounts

Enterprise accounts are usually associated with SAP customer or partner contracts and contain their purchased entitlements to platform resources and services. However, it's also possible to create an enterprise account for personal exploration.

SAP BTP provides different types of global accounts, **enterprise** and **trial**. The type you choose determines pricing, conditions of use, resources, available services, and hosts.

If you want to start out using services for free, you can create an enterprise account and only use free tier service plans: The major benefit of using such an account for exploration purposes is that you can upgrade your services to productive use without losing any of your data. Check out the [Free Tier Services](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/#/viewServices?provider=all&regions=all&category=freetierservices) in SAP Discovery Center and learn the details about [Using Free Service Plans](using-free-service-plans-524e108.md) in your enterprise account.

Another way to start out using services for free is to create a trial account. But keep in mind that when you want to use your global account productively, there’s no way to migrate your data from the trial account to a productive enterprise account. For more information, see [Trial Accounts and Free Tier](trial-accounts-and-free-tier-046f127.md).
