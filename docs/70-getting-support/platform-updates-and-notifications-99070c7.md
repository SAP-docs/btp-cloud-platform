## Reasons for Region Updates

Regions are updated in the following cases:

-   **Biweekly updates** \(standard\) - aligned with the contractual obligations to customers and partners. Such updates usually don’t affect productive applications, because most services support zero downtime maintenance. For more information about the biweekly updates, see [Consolidated Release Schedules for SAP BTP](https://me.sap.com/notes/3430170), [Intelligent Enterprise Suite: Harmonized release calendar for SAP Cloud products](https://me.sap.com/notes/2888562), and [Service Level Agreement for SAP Cloud Services](https://www.sap.com/about/agreements/cloud-services.html?search=Service%20Level%20Agreement).
-   **Immediate updates** - fixes required for bugs that affect productive application operations, or due to urgent security fixes. In some cases, this might lead to downtime or application restart, for which the application groups receive a notification.
-   **Major upgrades** - happen rarely, in a bigger maintenance window, up to four times per year. For the time frames of the services' major upgrades, see [Service Level Agreement for SAP Cloud Services](https://www.sap.com/about/agreements/cloud-services.html?search=Service%20Level%20Agreement). We let you know about these upgrades 4 weeks in advance.
