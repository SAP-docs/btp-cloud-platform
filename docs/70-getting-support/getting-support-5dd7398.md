## Prerequisites

Before you report an incident, ensure the following:



### Check Platform Status

-   **Running on the AWS, Azure, or GCP regions:** visit [SAP Trust Center](https://www.sap.com/about/trust-center/cloud-service-status.html). You can check:

    -   availability by service on *Cloud Status* tab page;

    -   availability by region on the *Data Center* tab page.


    For more information about selected platform incidents, see [Root Cause Analyses](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SCP_RCA/Latest/en-US).

-   **Running on the China \(Shanghai\) region:** check [https://status.cn40.platform.sapcloud.cn/](https://status.cn40.platform.sapcloud.cn/).

-   **Running on the Government Cloud \(US\) region:** planned downtimes and outage communication are sent through e-mail to the initial administrator of your global account.




### Check Tools Versions

Make sure that you've the latest versions of the tools you're using \(recommended\), or at least the versions you're using are still supported. For more information, see [SAP Development Tools](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/).

> ### Note:  
> Trial users \(without an S-user\) can ask for support by posting a question in [SAP Community](https://www.sap.com/community/topic/cloud-platform.html). However, they should first check for answers in [SAP Community](https://www.sap.com/community/topic/cloud-platform.html) and [Guided Answers](https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/#/tree/2065/actions/26547).
