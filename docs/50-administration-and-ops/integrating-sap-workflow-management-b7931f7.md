# Integrating SAP Workflow Management

You can enable the communication between the ABAP environment and the workflow capability within the SAP Workflow Management service.

This scenario enables the ABAP environment applications to extend their business processes by using the workflow capability in the Cloud Foundry environment. It allows the provisioning of an API in the ABAP environment to start and control workflow instances running on workflow capability.

You set up the scenario using the following tasks:

1.  [Create a Communication Arrangement Using a Service Key](create-a-communication-arrangement-using-a-service-key-e66e844.md) \(recommended\)

2.  [Create a Destination](create-a-destination-da60b99.md)
