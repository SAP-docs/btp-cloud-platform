# Deploy an Application

You can use the SAP BTP cockpit to deploy a new application in the Cloud Foundry environment.



<a name="loio09fdb9bdc6804c479d634297f1d07e09__prereq_mhg_cyp_12c"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You have the Space Developer role. For more information, see [About Roles in the Cloud Foundry Environment](about-roles-in-the-cloud-foundry-environment-0907638.md).

-   You have enough space quota, or enough org quota if no space quota is assigned to the space. For more information, see [Managing Space Quotas](managing-space-quotas-4e5f0ee.md).




## Procedure

1.  In your Cloud Foundry subaccount, navigate to the space where you would like to deploy your application.

2.  On the *Applications* page, choose *Deploy Application*.

3.  Choose the location of the file which contains your application.

4.  \(Optional\) If you would like to use a manifest, choose the location of your `manifest.yml` file.

    > ### Note:  
    > To avoid any unexpected behavior, specify the attributes of your choice and their respective values in the `manifest.yml` file. For reference, see [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest-attributes.html](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest-attributes.html).

5.  \(Optional\) If you don't want to use a manifest, select the *Custom Settings* radio button and enter the application details.

    1.  Enter a name for your application.

    2.  \(Optional\) Edit the amount of memory and disk space available to each instance of your application, as well as the number of instances.

        The amount of memory per instance that you assign, in this step or in the `manifest.yml` file during deployment, is the value that is metered when using the Cloud Foundry runtime service. For more information, see the examples in [Monitoring and Troubleshooting](https://help.sap.com/viewer/4287333baaa6413a8ece0a8ed1196af4/Cloud/en-US/2d6eb4d7181d4e8f8d7091158957b730.html).

        > ### Note:  
        > By default, each instance of a new application is assigned 1024 MB of memory and 512 MB of disk space, and each application starts with 1 instance. If you require more or less resources, edit the prefilled fields in the form to suit your needs.

    3.  \(Optional\) If you don't need a route for your application, switch off *Create Route*.

    4.  \(Optional\) If you would like to create a route for your application, leave *Create Route* switched on and choose a *Host* name \(if different from your application name\) and a *Domain* for your application.

        > ### Note:  
        > When you enter an application name, the *Host* field is automatically filled with the same name. You can make changes to it or leave it as is. After deciding on a host and domain, you can see a preview of your final *Application Route* at the bottom of the form.


6.  Choose *Deploy*.

## Results

The file containing your new application is uploaded and your application is deployed.

> ### Note:  
> If an application is displayed as *Started* according to the *Requested State* column, it doesn't automatically mean that the application is started. This is the desired state, but there might be an issue with an application instance. For any warning alerts, check the *Instances* column.
> 
> To get more detailed information about the current state of your application instances, navigate to the *Overview* page of the application.
