# Adding and Deleting a Kyma Module

To use a Kyma module, you must add it first. Use Kyma dashboard or Kyma CLI to do that. If you don't need the module anymore, delete it to save resources.

## Adding a Kyma Module



## Procedure

-   Use Kyma dashboard

    1.  Go to Kyma dashboard. The URL is in the Overview section of your subaccount.

    2.  Choose *Modify Modules* \> *Add*.

    3.  In the *Add Modules* section, check the modules you want to add, and select *Add*.

    4.  **Optional:** At the module level, you can overwrite the default release channel for the modules you are adding. Under the *Advanced* options, choose your preferred release channel.


    This process may take a while, depending on the number of modules. The operation was successful when the module status changes to ***READY***.

-   Use Kyma CLI

    > ### Caution:  
    > The `alpha` group commands are still in development, which means their functions and API may be modified over time. We encourage you to explore them, but keep in mind that changes may occur.

    1.  Check the list of modules that are available to be added:

        ```
        kyma alpha module catalog
        ```

    2.  Add a new module:

        -   To add a new module with the default configuration, use the following command:

            ```
            kyma alpha module add {MODULE-NAME} --default-cr
            ```

        -   To add a module with your specific configuration, create a YAML file containing your module custom resource \(CR\) settings, and use the`--cr-path={CR-FILEPATH}` flag:

            ```
            kyma alpha module add {MODULE-NAME} --cr-path={CR-FILEPATH}
            
            ```

        -   To add a module with the specified release channel, use the `-c {CHANNEL-NAME}` flag:

            ```
            kyma alpha module add {MODULE-NAME} -c {CHANNEL-NAME} --default-cr
            
            ```


        To see if your module is added, run the following command.

        ```
        kyma alpha module list
        ```
