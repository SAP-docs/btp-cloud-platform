# Identity and Access Management

Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) enables you to control user access to apps and specify what business users can do and see in the apps.



The main elements of IAM are business catalogs, business roles, and business users. The IAM apps secure the access to your solution based on these elements. For more information about how these elements interrelate, refer to [Business Roles, Business Catalogs, App Authorization Variants, Restrictions](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/53e36b5493804bcdb3f6f14de8b487dd/d45c96e6d9e2426187920bffb3287f45.html).

Access to business apps is controlled by a role-based authorization management. That means you assign business roles to users and these business roles provide access to certain business tasks.

You can also assign business users to business roles in the **Maintain Business Roles** app. The main purpose of the app though is to create and adapt business roles. You create business roles by combining pre-defined business catalogs that contain the actual authorizations that allow users to access apps for a specific business area. If necessary, you can change the restrictions for the access categories value help, read, and write on field level. Once you have created a business role, you can assign it to multiple business users who perform similar business tasks in the **Maintain Business Users** app. Business users are all persons that need access to your solution, such as employees or contractors.

As opposed to business users, technical users aren't persons, but rather services that are used to automate technical tasks in the system, for example, a communication user. The **Display Technical Users** app shows you what technical users are available in your solution.

> ### Note:  
> We recommend that you use the *Manage Business Role Changes After Upgrade* app as a starting point to carry out regular release activities.

> ### Note:  
> To find out which business roles grant access to which apps, you can use the*IAM Information System* app. On the *Business Role - Application* tab, you can display all apps per business role as well as the corresponding business catalog IDs. If you select *Application* in the *Main Entity* dropdown list, you can search for apps and see which business roles and business catalogs provide access to them. For more information, refer to [IAM Information System](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/53e36b5493804bcdb3f6f14de8b487dd/82d17cfdb0f3464b9735e4ded705f71f.html).
> 
> If you donâ€™t have access to the *IAM Information System* app, you can still find out which business catalogs grant access to which apps using the SAP Fiori Apps Reference Library.

To have access to these apps, your user needs to be assigned to a business role which contains one of the following business catalogs:

-   *Identity and Access Management* \(SAP\_CORE\_BC\_IAM\)
-   *User Management* \(SAP\_CORE\_BC\_IAM\_UM\)
-   *Role Management* \(SAP\_CORE\_BC\_IAM\_RM\)
