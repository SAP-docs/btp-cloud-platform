## Prerequisites

To call an API of the Authorization and Trust Management Service you need to obtain an access token. See [Access UAA Admin APIs](access-uaa-admin-apis-ebc9113.md) to learn how to obtain an access token. See the following example how to call an endpoint with a curl request.

> ### Tip:  
> On the API Business Hub, a sandbox system is provided for you to make example calls to the different APIs and their endpoints.



## Procedure

1.  Authenticate a call to an API endpoint of the authorization API using the access token previously obtained as the value for a Bearer type token in an `Authorization` header.

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > In this example, we request the list of roles of an XSUAA configuration.
    > 
    > ```
    > curl \
    >   --url https://api.authentication.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/sap/rest/authorization/v2/roles \
    >   --header 'Accept: application/json' \
    >   --header 'Authorization: bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1N...' \
    >   --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    >   --header 'cache-control: no-cache'
    > ```
