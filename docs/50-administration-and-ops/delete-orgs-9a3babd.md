You can delete a Cloud Foundry org from a subaccount using the SAP BTP cockpit. Once the org is deleted, you can create a new one.

## Prerequisites

You are a global account administrator, as well as a member of the subaccount containing the org you want to delete.

> You can delete an org using only the cockpit or the btp CLI. You cannot use the Cloud Foundry CLI to perform this task.



## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the subaccount containing the org.

2.  Choose *Disable Cloud Foundry* and confirm the operation.
