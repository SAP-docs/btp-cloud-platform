## Context

There are two integration scenarios supporting data flow from Business Event Logging to the target systems:

-   SAP\_COM\_0A54: This integration scenario is for data federation/extraction from Business Event Logging to target systems.

-   SAP\_COM\_0532: This integration scenario is for data replication from Business Event Logging to target systems. You can use the schema `API_BusEvtLogEvent` from SAP\_COM\_A054 communication scenario.

    For more information on this communication scenario, see [Integrating SQL Services using SAP Datasphere](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/0f69f8fb28ac4bf48d2b57b9637e81fa/a91d39c3ea494344897fca7bc9578b85.html).
