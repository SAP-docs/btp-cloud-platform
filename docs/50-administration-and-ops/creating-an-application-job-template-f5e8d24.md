# Creating an Application Job Template

Find out how to create your own application job templates in the *Application Job Templates* app.



## Context

You can use the *Application Job Templates* app to create a job template for a specific business purpose so that you can schedule concrete jobs by reusing the job template.



## Procedure

1.  Open the *Application Job Templates* app.

2.  Choose *Create* to create a new job template.

3.  Enter a name and specify your preferred scheduling options.

4.  Tick the *Shared Template* checkbox if you want other users to be able to view or edit the job template. If you share the template, all users who have access to the *Application Job Templates* app, and who have the appropriate authorizations, can make the same changes as you.

5.  Select *Maintain Steps* and choose *Add* to add an existing template as step. This step can be repeated many times to create a multi-step template.

6.  Click *Save Job Template*. Now, you can view each parameter of your selected templates in the *Parameter Section* and edit the values according to your needs.

7.  If you are done editing, you can now choose whether to check your parameters, or display, save, or cancel your job template. When clicking *Save* to save your job template, you can choose to save and reload the page to be able to view the values you've entered previously by selecting *Save and Reload*. Mind that this may trigger a longer reload of new values. If you want to get back to the main page and continue working, choose *Save and Back*.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you want to schedule multistep templates with the *Application Jobs* app, you'll need the appropriate authorizations for all steps.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can choose to skip a single execution of a periodic job chain. To do so, select *Skip*.
