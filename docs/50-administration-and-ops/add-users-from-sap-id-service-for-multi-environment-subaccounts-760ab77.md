# Add Users from SAP ID Service for Multi-Environment Subaccounts

Before you can assign role collection to a user from SAP ID service, ensure that this user exists in your subaccount.

## Prerequisites

The user you want to add to your subaccount must have an SAP user account \(for example, an S-user or P-user\).

For more information, see [Create SAP User Accounts](create-sap-user-accounts-ebe42f6.md).



## Context

When you create your own trial account, your SAP user is automatically created and assigned to SAP ID service. When you onboard new members to your subscribed app, add them to your subaccount. Then you can assign a role collection to the user.

## Procedure

Create users and assign role collections to users in *Security* \> *Users*.

It's possible to create users in custom identity providers and in the SAP ID service.
