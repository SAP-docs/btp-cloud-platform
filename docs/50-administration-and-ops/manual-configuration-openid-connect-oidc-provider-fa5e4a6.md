# Manual Configuration - OpenID Connect \(OIDC\) Provider

When you have made the required settings under *OpenID Connect \(OIDC\) Provider* – *Basic Configuration* in the *Edit* mode of the communication system, the system attempts to automatically configure OpenID Connect for the provider you have defined. If the provider does not convey the required information, you receive an error message. In this case, you can use manual configuration as a fallback. Activate the *Manual Configuration* switch if this is required.

As a first step, you can download web keys from the provider. Should this fail too, you can directly enter the web keys as defined in your OpenID Connect specification.
