# About Roles in the Cloud Foundry Environment

Roles determine which features users can view and access, and which actions they can initiate.

Cloud Foundry includes predefined roles that are specific to the navigation level in the SAP BTP cockpit; for example, the roles at the level of the organization differ from the ones for the space. Each role comes with a set of permissions. Roles apply to all operations that are associated with the organization or the space, irrespective of the tool used \(Eclipse-based tools, SAP BTP cockpit, and cf CLI\).

The following roles can be assigned to users in the Cloud Foundry environment on SAP BTP:
