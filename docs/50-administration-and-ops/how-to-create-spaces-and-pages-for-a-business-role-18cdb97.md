<a name="loio18cdb97492114be9b9001cfbea7821af__HowToCreateSpacePage_context"/>

## Context

When creating a new business role, you can create a new launchpad space, use an existing launchpad space or launchpad spaces based on a predefined space. If required, you can add multiple spaces to the role by clicking *Add* on the *Assigned Launchpad Spaces* tab. If a launchpad space is no longer relevant for a role, you can click *Remove*. Please note that you can assign an existing launchpad space to several business roles at once. For more information, see the *Related Information* section.
