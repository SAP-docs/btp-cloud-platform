## Context

To help improve user experience in the SAP BTP Cockpit, global account administrators can allow global account users to send anonymized usage data to SAP. By enabling analytics in the cockpit, we'll identify and fix issues more quickly, making for an improved cockpit experience. We use analytics to understand how users interact with the platform. With this information, we can make improvements, such as adapting navigation patterns, enhancing customer support, and prioritizing features.

What kind of data do we collect?

-   Cockpit usage data: How often a page is opened or which functionality \(buttons, links\) is used or not used
-   Click paths: The navigational paths a user takes to navigate through the cockpit

What data don't we collect?

-   Personal, user-specific, or company identifying data
-   User input

Your data is used to improve the overall user experience and cannot be used for marketing or advertising purposes.



## Procedure

1.  Open the global account for which you'd like to enable analytics.

    If you are the Global Account Owner and analytics has not yet been enabled, a dialog box will automatically appear when you access the global account. Here you can enable analytics by clicking "Allow for this Global Account." You can also choose to no longer see this information or decide later following the steps below.

2.  Navigate to the global account settings by clicking :gear:.

3.  Select **Consent Management**.

4.  Toggle the button for **Help improve the BTP cockpit experience**.

5.  Save your changes.

## Results

After you have enabled analytics in the global account, each global account user must also provide their consent before anonymized usage data is sent to SAP. All users of a global account can change their consent choice at any time by accessing Cookie Preferences in the Legal Information menu located in the lower left. Global account administrators can also update or withdraw global account consent at any time in the global account settings.
