# Best Practices for Business Roles



We recommend the following procedures in connection with business roles:

-   We recommend that you design your business role in a particularly specific way so that only a limited number of business users can be assigned to them. This means that only one business role should be available per specifically designed job or work environment. For example a finance developer role that is intended for about 35 developers or an IAM developer role that is intended for about 30 developers.
-   We recommend assigning a business user to no more than five business roles, though ideally just to one.
-   Do not edit a business role in the target system after the transport. We recommend that you only edit business roles in the source system before the tranport.
-   Choose *Unrestricted \(‘\*’\)* instead of selecting all restriction field values.
-   Not more than 100 business catalogs should be assigned to a business role.
