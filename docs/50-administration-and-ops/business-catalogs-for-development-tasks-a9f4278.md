# Business Catalogs for Development Tasks

Get an overview of available business catalogs for development tasks and their restrictions.



You assign business catalogs to business roles that are assigned to business users. Business catalogs contain authorizations that define what a business user with a certain business role is allowed to do.

Certain business catalogs are only available in development systems \(see [Creating an ABAP System](../20-getting-started/creating-an-abap-system-50b32f1.md)\).
