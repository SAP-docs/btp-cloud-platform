Cloud Connector 

</td>
<td valign="top">

You can connect a Cloud Connector with multi-environment and Neo subaccounts of SAP BTP.

For more information, see [Use a Custom IDP for Subaccount Configuration](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/202261235a204db5ba0b35bbaa6d40ff.html "Enable custom identity provider (IDP) authentication to configure a Multi-Cloud subaccount in the Cloud Connector by using a one-time passcode.") :arrow_upper_right:.

> ### Note:  
> In addition to the initial connection from Cloud Connector to SAP BTP, the regular rotation of the client certificate that is used for the ongoing connection, is also affected.

SAP BTP Command Line Interface \(btp CLI\)

</td>
<td valign="top">

Once trust has been configured on the global account level in the cockpit, platform users can log on using the custom identity provider and use the full range of the btp CLI.

To log on to a global account, you need to provide the hostname of the tenant \(for example, *ar9ibaxhm*\) with the `--idp` parameter. See [Log in with a Custom Identity Provider](log-in-with-a-custom-identity-provider-e48e486.md).

To work with users and role collections on global account, directory, or subaccount level, you need to provide the origin key with the `--of-idp` parameter in the following commands: `btp list security/user`, `btp get security/user`, `btp delete security/user`, `btp assign security/role-collection`, `btp unassign security/role-collection`.

Both values can be found in the cockpit under *Security* → *Trust Configuration* → *Custom Platform Identity Providers*.

Cloud Foundry command-line interface \(CF CLI\)

Make sure you use the Cloud Foundry command-line interface \(CF CLI v7\). For more information, see [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/v7.html](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/v7.html).

> ### Restriction:  
> With v6 of the CF CLI, you can't use the `--origin` option in `cf set-org-role` and `cf set-space-role`. Use the *Members* tab in the SAP BTP cockpit. Go to the SAP BTP cockpit under **<my\_global\_account\>** \> **<my\_subaccount\>** \> *Security* \> *Members* to set the user's permissions.
