# Account Administration Using Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code \(IaC\) automates infrastructure provisioning and management using code. It helps ensure consistency, scalability, versioning, collaboration, and documentation. The Terraform Provider for SAP BTP allows you to provision and manage SAP BTP resources as code, with open-source support.

## What is Infrastructure as Code?

Infrastructure as Code \(IaC\) is an approach to managing and provisioning infrastructure resources as code, using machine-readable configuration files or scripts, instead of manually configuring them. Infrastructure configurations are written in a programming language and usually stored in version control systems, so they can easily be shared, reviewed, and modified, enabling collaboration and reproducibility.

The following are some benefits of the IaC approach:

-   **Automation**: It allows for the automation of infrastructure provisioning and management processes. Infrastructure can be created, modified, and destroyed programmatically, reducing the need for manual intervention and minimizing human error.

-   **Consistency**: By defining infrastructure as code, you can ensure that your infrastructure is consistently provisioned and configured across different environments, such as development, testing, and production. This helps in reducing configuration drift and improves reliability.

-   **Scalability**: IaC enables the ability to scale infrastructure resources up or down based on demand. By defining infrastructure configurations in code, you can easily replicate and deploy infrastructure resources in a consistent and repeatable manner.

-   **Versioning and Collaboration**: IaC configurations can be stored in version control systems, allowing you to track changes over time and roll back to previous versions if needed. It also enables collaboration among team members, as multiple people can work on the same infrastructure codebase simultaneously.

-   **Documentation**: IaC serves as a form of documentation, providing a clear and concise representation of the desired infrastructure state. It helps in understanding the infrastructure architecture and facilitates knowledge sharing within the team.


Overall, Infrastructure as Code brings the principles and practices of software development to infrastructure management, with the goal of enabling organizations to achieve greater agility, scalability, and reliability in their infrastructure operations.
