## Feature Set B: Global Account Settings

As a global account administrator, you can access the global account settings by clicking <span class="SAP-icons"></span> in the SAP BTP cockpit.

In the *General* tab of the global account settings, you can identify your global account subdomain.

In the *Subaccount Defaults* tab in the global account settings, you can set the supported providers, the default provider, and the default region. These defaults are used when creating a new subaccount in this global account.
