# Manage Security Audit Log \(Deprecated\)



With this app, you can manage Security Audit Log related parameters.



## Key Features

You can use this app to:

-   Each parameter can be active or inactive, so that changing the parameter value is possible without having the change immediately active
-   Maintain parameter `DELETE`:
    -   Maintain the default audit log retention time in days. After the number of days the Security Audit Log Events will be removed from database to reduce the consumption of the SAP HANA DB storage. The default retention period is 45 days. Confirm the default by activating the parameter `DELETE`, or define a custom retention period.


Mark the parameter you want to change and switch to *Edit* mode. Select the option for *Parameter Status* \(active or inactive\) and for *Parameter Value* \(Keep, Replace, or Clear Value\) and save your settings.
