# How to Manage Business Role Template Changes After an Upgrade



## Context

To get an overview of changes in the business role template area since the last upgrade, you can display any differences between business role and business role template in the *How to Manage Business Role Changes After an Upgrade* app. Either the template or the role that was based on the template might have changed. For example, business catalogs might have been added or removed. To apply these changes in a detailed maintenance screen, you can cross-navigate to the *Business Role Templates* app.



## Procedure

1.  Select the *Manage Business Role Changes After Upgrade* tile on the SAP Fiori Launchpad to open the app. On the initial screen, the *Business Role Templates* area provides an overview of what has changed with the latest upgrade.

2.  Download a csv file containing all recently changed business templates if required.

3.  Click on the required business role template for details of the changes. The type of change \(for example *Different from Business Roles*\) is already displayed on the initial screen.

4.  To display a detailed comparison, select one or more affected business roles and click *Compare with Business Role Template*. This takes you to the *Business Role Templates* app.

5.  All deviations of the business roles from the business role templates are displayed in a table. You can click *Apply All* if you want to take over all of the changes. Alternatively, you can go through the list and select deviations you would like to apply.

    You can define one role as leading and all changes you make to this role will be automatically transferred to the roles you selected in the *Deviations* table.

6.  Click *Save* when you're done.

    Please note that you can also adjust your business roles directly in the *Business Role Templates* app.
