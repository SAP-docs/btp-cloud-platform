# Custom Code Migration



## Purpose

The `Custom Code Migration` app enables you to create three different kinds of projects:

1.  SAP S/4HANA Migration Project:

    Analyze custom code that shall be migrated from an existing product like SAP Business Suite to a new product such as SAP S/4HANA 2023. To evaluate the custom objects to be adapted, it performs the SAP S/4HANA custom code checks.

2.  SAP BTP Analysis Project:

    Analyze custom code for readiness to run in SAP BTP, ABAP environment.

3.  Custom Code Analysis Project:

    Analyze custom code with arbitrary ATC check variants. See [Performing an Analysis](performing-an-analysis-5c758da.md).


In addition, this app supports you with identifying unused custom code based on your collected usage data. This enables you to remove unused custom code during a system conversion to SAP S/4HANA.
