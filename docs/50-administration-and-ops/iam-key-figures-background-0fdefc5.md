# IAM Key Figures - Background

The charts in the **IAM Key Figures** app support you to increase the security in your area and to reduce costs by displaying which business users are inactive and can be removed.

They also provide a helpful overview that can be useful before go-live. For example, it helps you to evaluate whether the business user and role distribution in your area is ready for use.

To define threshold values, you can use color codes for the bars in your charts. The following colors are available:

-   Green: **Accepted**
-   Yellow: **Warning**
-   Red:**Critical**

> ### Example:  
> You can define the colors based on certain time frames. If a user has not logged on to the system for 6 months and you want to use this point in time as a threshold value, you can determine that the corresponding bar in the chart is red.

You can also jump directly to the **Maintain Business Users** app or **Maintain Business Roles** app if you need more information about the business users or business roles that are shown in the overview charts.
