# Get Updates

Updating the btp CLI client is essentially replacing the old executable file with a newer version.



<a name="loioe92aa7859bc94a07a764f49c0437ead3__context_u1f_2kd_yjb"/>

## Context

Each btp CLI client version is supported for at least a year after its release, but we recommend to regularly update the client. This way, you won't miss any new features or security updates. The [What's New for SAP Business Technology Platform](https://help.sap.com/whats-new/cf0cb2cb149647329b5d02aa96303f56?Component=SAP%20BTP%20Command%20Line%20Interface&locale=en-US&version=Cloud) page on SAP Help Portal announces new features and informs you if you need a client update to use them. If your client version is deprecated, an update hint is displayed in the client as well.

To find out the version of the CLI client you are using, run `btp --info` or simply `btp`.



## Procedure

1.  Get the latest version either by re-running the installation script or downloading the client manually.

2.  Extract the client file \(for example: `btp.exe`\) and replace the old file with this new one.

3.  Work with the btp CLI as usual and enjoy the new features.
