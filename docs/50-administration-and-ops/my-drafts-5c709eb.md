# My Drafts



With this app, you can display drafts that are created by you, being processed by you, or assigned to you. With the remove enqueue action, you can release the durable lock before it will be released automatically. This enables other user to discard the old draft and create a new one.

-   Sort drafts by a specific sort order in the result list.

-   Hide or show columns in the list.

-   Filter the number of drafts using additional criteria.
