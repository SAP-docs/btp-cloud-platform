# Performing a Custom Code Analysis

This guide describes how to perform remote custom code analysis using the Analyze Custom Code app.

The Analyze Custom Code app in the SAP BTP ABAP environment can act as the ABAP Test Cockpit \(ATC\), a central check system analyzing the ABAP source code located in your on-premise system. It enables you to identify functional or security vulnerabilities in your ABAP source code. This includes security checks performed by the SAP Code Vulnerability Analyzer \(CVA\). Further cloud use cases for ATC in the Analyze Custom Code app involve the migration to S/4HANA, performance checks, and ABAP Cloud readiness checks.

In the following chapters, you will learn how to create a custom code analysis project, analyze the findings, and, in addition, perform dependency and complexity analyses.
