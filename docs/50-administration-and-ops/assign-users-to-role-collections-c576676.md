# Assign Users to Role Collections

You can assign users to a role collection by adding them to the role collection.



## Context

You can assign users from default identity providers, and from custom identity providers, to a role collection. After having entered the user's user ID, choose the origin key of the identity provider and the e-mail address.



## Procedure

1.  Open the SAP BTP cockpit.

2.  Go to your global account or subaccount \(see [Navigate in the Cockpit](navigate-in-the-cockpit-0874895.md)\).

3.  Choose *Security* \> *Role Collections*.

4.  Choose the role collection to which you want to assign users.

5.  Go to the *Users* section and choose *Edit*.

6.  Enter the user ID, identity provider, and e-mail address of the user that you want to assign to the role collection.

7.  \(Optional\) To add more users, choose :heavy_plus_sign: \(Add a user\).

8.  Save your changes.

    You've now assigned this user to the role collection. The user has the authorizations of the role collection.
