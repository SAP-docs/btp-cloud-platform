# Assign Users to Role Collections

You can assign users to role collections by adding them to the desired role collection in the SAP BTP cockpit. Use this function to manage user authorizations and access control within your global account or subaccount in the cloud platform.



## Context

You can assign users to a role collection. After having entered the user's user ID, choose the name of the trust configuration and the e-mail address.



## Procedure

1.  Open the SAP BTP cockpit.

2.  Go to your global account or subaccount \(see [Navigate in the Cockpit](navigate-in-the-cockpit-0874895.md)\).

3.  Choose *Security* \> *Role Collections*.

4.  Choose the role collection to which you want to assign users.

5.  Go to the *Users* section and choose *Edit*.

6.  Enter the user ID, identity provider, and e-mail address of the user that you want to assign to the role collection.

7.  \(Optional\) To add more users, choose :heavy_plus_sign: \(Add a user\).

8.  Save your changes.

    You've now assigned this user to the role collection. The user has the authorizations of the role collection.
