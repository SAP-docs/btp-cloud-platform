Audit logs are a special type of logs. They represent security-relevant chronological records that provide documentary evidence for an event or activity. The following table gives you a better understanding what is the difference between audit logs, activity logs, and application logs. The SAP Audit Log only stores audit logs written by SAP BTP services, when you take action over your account data.

The SAP Audit Log stores audit logs representing different actions taken over your account and/or data. There are predefined audit categories, which represent such kinds of actions:

-   Data protection and privacy related

    -   *audit.data-access* read-access logging records for access to sensitive personal data;

    -   *audit.data-modification* data modification logging records for sensitive personal data.


    Security related

    -   *audit.security-events* logging of general security events like login, logout, and other;

    -   *audit.configuration* logging of security critical configuration changes.
