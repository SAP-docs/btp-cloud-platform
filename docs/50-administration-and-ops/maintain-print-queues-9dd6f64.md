# Maintain Print Queues



## Purpose

Using this app, you can set up print queues to manage the printing of documents and monitor the print jobs in each queue.

This helps you to identify and analyze errors and gives you a sense of direction for doing troubleshooting to solve them.



## Key Features

With this app you can:

-   Create a new print queue
-   Delete a print queue
-   Pause a print queue

    This allows you to stop print items from being collected by the printing process while you are carrying out repairs.

-   Restart a print queue
-   Check the status \(such as *New* , *Failed* , *Transmitted* , *Successful*, *Warning*\) of queues or individual print items in the queue and display detailed information regarding the status
-   Reassign a print item to another print queue
