# Maintain User Sessions



With this app administrators can monitor and control users’ logon sessions in the system. You can filter by user ID or name, see when each session was last used, the session index, how many locks it holds, and the client/device IP address. From the list, admins can select sessions and delete/end them to free locks, resolve stuck processes, reclaim resources, and support security or troubleshooting activities.

> ### Caution:  
> If sessions are related to drafts they cannot be deleted.



## Prerequisites

To access the app, you need to have the `SAP_CORE_BC_CST_DP_MAS_PC` business catalog assigned to your user.



## Key Features

You can use this app to:



-   View details of users’ logon sessions in the system, such as user IDs, user names, or number of locks, and client/device IP addresses.

-   Delete sessions if required.

    > ### Caution:  
    > The business user does not get a warning message when a session is deleted. Therefore, we recommend that you do this with caution.
