# Best Practices for Joule in the Cockpit

Let Joule help you find answers to questions about managing your accounts in SAP BTP cockpit.

> ### Note:  
> Joule general availability is currently being rolled out in stages to global accounts during the second quarter of 2025. If Joule is available for your global account, the Global Account Administrator will first need to enable Joule in the Global Account settings by accepting the legal Terms and Conditions for Generative AI. Only then will the Joule icon appear in the cockpit tool header.

Joule is your AI copilot in the SAP BTP Cockpit. You can leverage Joule's generative AI capabilities to help you retrieve information about your accounts and their users. Joule can also answer questions about the cockpit and SAP BTP. Just type a question in the Joule chat using natural language and let Joule scan the product documentation on the SAP Help Portal for answers. Joule summarizes the relevant SAP Help Portal information. This summary is then displayed along with the top help results. If you select a link result, you're taken directly to the topic on the SAP Help Portal.

> ### Note:  
> Joule is currently only available for English-language inputs and conversations.

> ### Note:  
> Joule is an addition to in-app help content, guided tours, embedded learning content, and customer-specific enablement content in SAP Companion.

**New to Joule?**Here are some tips to help you get started:

-   To see **what Joule can do for you**, just ask! For example, you can type, What can you do for me?
-   You can **reset the conversation** at any time by clicking the reset button in the middle of the chat window.
-   You can **hide the Joule chat window** by clicking the X and pick up right where you left off by selecting the Joule icon in the cockpit tool header.
-   **Conversations expire after 15 minutes**. When this happens, Joule will notify you and give you the option to start a new conversation.
