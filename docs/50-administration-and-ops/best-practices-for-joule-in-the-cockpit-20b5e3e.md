**New to Joule?**Here are some tips to help you get started:

-   To see **what Joule can do for you**, just ask! For example, you can type, What can you do for me?
-   You can **start a new the conversation** at any time by selecting the *New Conversation* button in the Joule menu.
-   You can **hide the Joule chat window** by selecting the X and pick up right where you left off by selecting the Joule icon in the cockpit tool header.
-   **Conversations expire after 8 hours**. When this happens, Joule will notify you and give you the option to start a new conversation.
-   Joule responds best to **single requests**. For example, if you want to see the users in your global account and also in a specific subaccount, send these requests as two separate queries.
-   You may find that **selecting a suggested action or option** will provide better results than typing.
-   Providing additional **context** may also help Joule provide a better answer. For example, if you want to see users of a specific subaccount, Joule may need more context and ask for the subaccount ID or name.
-   Want to give feedback about your experience with Joule in the BTP cockpit? Simply type or select the quick start button *give feedback*.
