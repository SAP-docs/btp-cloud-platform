### Best practices when writing prompts

Joule can help you with a number of different scenarios, from finding information to completing certain tasks. The responses depend strongly on how you write your prompt.

When you want Joule to **perform a task**, it’s best to treat your prompt like a command. Using verbs such as “add”, “show” or “go to” will help Joule understand you want it to perform an action. Adding keywords like “subaccount” or “space” can also influence how Joule interprets the task.

When you need to **find information** about something, write your prompt as an open question. Inquiries like “How to create a CF space?” and “Where can I find instructions for entitlements?” will help Joule look for document-based answers. In this case, avoid using too many keywords in the same prompt that might cause Joule to misinterpret your request.

Joule also responds best to **single requests**. For example, if you want to see the users in your global account and in a specific subaccount, send these requests as two separate queries.

Finally, giving additional **context** may also help Joule provide a better answer. For example, if you want to see users of a specific subaccount, Joule may ask for the subaccount ID or name.
