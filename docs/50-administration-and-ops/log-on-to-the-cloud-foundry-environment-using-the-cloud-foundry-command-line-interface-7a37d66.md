<a name="loio7a37d66c2e7d401db4980db0cd74aa6b__prereq_dxb_jzc_wbb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   The Cloud Foundry environment is enabled. You can enable it in the Cloud Platform Cockpit. For more information, see [Create a Subaccount](create-a-subaccount-05280a1.md).

-   \(Enterprise accounts only\) You have created at least one subaccount and enabled the Cloud Foundry environment in this subaccount. For more information, see [Create a Subaccount](create-a-subaccount-05280a1.md).

    > ### Note:  
    > In a Cloud Foundry trial account, the Cloud Foundry environment has been activated for you automatically and a first space "dev" has been created for you.

-   Download and install the cf CLI and log on to Cloud Foundry. For more information, see [Download and Install the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](download-and-install-the-cloud-foundry-command-line-interface-4ef907a.md).

## Procedure

1.  Open a command line.

2.  Set the target API endpoint to the cloud controller.

    > ### Note:  
    > There is no specific endpoint for trial accounts. Both enterprise and trial accounts use the same API endpoints.

    ```
    cf api https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com
    ```



    For more information, see [Regions and API Endpoints Available for the Cloud Foundry Environment](../10-concepts/regions-and-api-endpoints-available-for-the-cloud-foundry-environment-f344a57.md).

3.  Log on to the Cloud Foundry environment:

    ```
    cf login
    ```

    > ### Note:  
    > -   To log on with SAP Universal ID, use the option `--sso`. You need a browser in the logon process.
    > 
    >     For more information, see [Log On Manually With a Custom Identity Provider](log-on-manually-with-a-custom-identity-provider-e1009b4.md).
    > 
    >     Otherwise log on with the password associated with your account \(S-user or P-user\) in the default identity provider, SAP ID service. If you have multiple user accounts with the same email address, log on with your user ID \(S-user or P-user\) instead of your email address.
    > 
    >     If you've forgotten this password and this user is associated with your SAP Universal ID user, reset your password.
    > 
    >     For more information, see SAP Note [3085908](https://me.sap.com/notes/3085908).
    > 
    > -   To log on with a specific identity provider, use the option `--origin`.
    > 
    >     For more information, see [Log On as a Technical User With a Custom Identity Provider](log-on-as-a-technical-user-with-a-custom-identity-provider-98ec56a.md).

4.  When prompted, enter your user credentials \(email and password\). 

5.  To view the help for the CLI, execute <code><code>cf help</code></code>, which lists the most common CLI commands with a short description, or `cf help -a`, which lists all commands. To get help for a specific command, execute <code><code>cf help <i class="varname">&lt;command&gt;</i></code></code>.
