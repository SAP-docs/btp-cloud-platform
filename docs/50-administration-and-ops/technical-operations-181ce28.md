# Technical Operations

Learn more about what you can do to operate your ABAP environment.

As an administrator in the ABAP environment, you need metrics and alerts to monitor the availability and performance of your systems. You also need an indication whether your purchased service volume has been exhausted. Therefore, the following metrics and alerts are particularly relevant for the ABAP environment:

-   Utilization metrics for computing, storage, and network resources

-   Performance metrics

-   Exceptional situations such as aborted jobs or runtime errors


In the ABAP environment, you have different tools available to support you with your tasks.

## Local Monitoring

For local monitoring of your ABAP environment, you can use the technical monitoring cockpit. In the technical monitoring cockpit, multiple monitoring screens help you identify and solve bottlenecks and performance issues by giving you an in-depth view on important technical data of the database and application server, such as CPU, memory, network, storage, performance, time spent, workload, and configuration. You can use the technical monitoring cockpit also for a profound analysis of the most important entities, such as work processes, tables, SQL traces, and SQL statements.

## System Landscape Monitoring

For monitoring an entire system landscape, consider using a central monitoring and alerting infrastructure. If you use SAP Focused Run or SAP Cloud ALM for monitoring your system landscape, you can use the integrated health monitoring for the ABAP environment.
