# Export Customizing Transports

With this app, business process configuration experts can manage business configuration changes recorded in requests.



Business configuration changes are recorded in requests, depending on the category to which the customizing objects belong. Unlike ABAP repository objects, customizing objects recorded in a request are accessible to other business users.

## Default Customizing Request

Since configuration changes recorded in requests of the type `Customizing Request` are not lockable, it might happen that several business users record their configuration changes in different requests.

Recording the configuration changes in different requests might create dependencies between these requests, however to avoid such dependencies, a new transport category is introduced.

Any new request created from this app is categorized as *Default*: In a client, there can be only one open default request of the type `Customizing Request`.

Business users can record their configuration changes to this default request to avoid any dependencies.

If you need to perform an emergency fix, record the configuration changes in a request which is not categorized as *Default*. Default requests are listed in the column *Transport Category*.
