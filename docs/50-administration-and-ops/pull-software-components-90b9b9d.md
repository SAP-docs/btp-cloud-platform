# Pull Software Components





### Context

You can pull \(remotely available\) changes of your software component to the service instance you are currently on. To do the pull, perform the following steps:

> ### Note:  
> Keep in mind that if a software component is not in your system yet, you will first need to clone it once. For more information see [Clone Software Components](clone-software-components-18564c5.md).



### Procedure

1.  Navigate to the detail page of a software component from the list and choose *Pull* in the page header.

2.  Select how you want to pull the software component. By selecting *Latest*, the last remote commit will be pulled into the system. Select *By Tag* if you want to pull a specific git tag, which has been assigned to a commit. Select *By Commit* if you want to pull a software component with a specific Commit ID.

    > ### Note:  
    > To pull a specific tag, at least one tag has to exist on a commit on the currently active branch.

    > ### Note:  
    > A rollback mechanism is activiated which allows an automatic roll back to the last valid commit of the repository, in case an invalid commit is pulled. We define an invalid commit as a commit that can cause import errors during a pull operation. The pull of invalid commits is allowed for development and test systems only. If only one out of multiple commits causes an issue, none of the commits will be pulled.
    > 
    > Nevertheless, this mechanism cannot reverse any data loss that may occur due to ABAP Dictionary changes. For example, in the case of field shortening of a database table, the field length can be rolled back, but the lost content remains irretrievable. Therefore, ensure that deployments to the production systems are checked in the advance \(via CI/CD processes\), for example on quality systems.

3.  Display the list of all pulls, checkouts and other actions by navigating to the *History* tab.

    To display pulls and checkouts that have been triggered for a particular software component, first select the component from the list and then scroll down to the *History* section where all actions are listed in the *Recent Actions* tables. In both cases, you will be navigated to the *Software Component Details* screen.

4.  To display or refresh the list of *Recent Actions*, choose *Go* or click on the refresh button inside the search bar.

    > The *<ID\>*, which is a unique key \(UUID\) of the software component is not in the table, but visible in the action detail page.

5.  You can display the pull details by choosing the entry from the list.

    The *Execution Log* and *Log Overview* are displayed as a table. You can find the new tables when navigating to the detail page of every action entry. Additionally, every log line is classified with a criticality level. A logline can have the criticality level "Information", "Success", "Warning" or "Error". Each level is represented with a colored criticality icon.

    Furthermore, you can also download the logs as an Excel-file. This may be helpful when communicating with SAP in the context of error analysis.

    > ### Note:  
    > Note that the execution logs and transport logs are deleted periodically. Please use the download feature in the UI or the OData service `MANAGE_GIT_REPOSITORY` \(see [Pulling Git Repositories to an ABAP Environment System](../30-development/pulling-git-repositories-to-an-abap-environment-system-80a8d52.md)\) to download the logs.
