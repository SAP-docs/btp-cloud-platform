# Message Monitoring for Integration Experts



With this app, you can display an overview of your interfaces and get details on all messages processed through them.



> ### Tip:  
> If you don't see the interface you're assigned to, verify that your user is assigned to the corresponding recipient using the *Assign Recipients to Users* app.



## Key Features

You can use this app to:



-   Get a tabular overview of your interfaces and all messages \(with specific status\) processed through them.

-   Filter your overview by time and/or interface, and restrict it to show only interfaces with messages or errors.

-   Drill down on the messages of a specific interface and filter them by time, status, and key fields \(if defined\).

-   Get more information on an individual message \(such as log messages, message details, and data structure\).

-   Download the payload of a specific message.

-   Edit, restart, or cancel a message \(if in status *Error* or *In Process*\) \(this functionality is only available for selected message formats\).

-   Perform mass error handling for multiple messages of an interface at once.

-   Set process information for a message \(such as defining a process status\).

-   Identify interfaces with an active alert and confirm the alert.

-   Define data links and dynamic data links for log messages without a predefined link.
