## Authorization

Because you're already logged into the SAP BTP cockpit, Joule recognizes you and can perform administrative actions on your behalf. It's important to know that Joule is bound to your cockpit authorization. In other words, Joule can only accomplish tasks for you that you're authorized to perform.
