## Procedure

1.  Open the SAP BTP cockpit.

2.  Go to your global account and subaccount \(see [Navigate in the Cockpit](navigate-in-the-cockpit-0874895.md)\).

    If you accidentally deleted the input field for the new roles, choose <span class="SAP-icons"></span> \(Add a role\) to display a new input field.

7.  Use the dropdown list or the F4 function key under *Role Name* to display the roles that are available. The roles are sorted alphabetically. Choose the role you want to add. You can also select multiple roles from the list below.
