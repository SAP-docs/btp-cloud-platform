# How to Delete Previously Transported Business Roles



## Context

If you want to delete a business role that was previously transported or is currently included in an open transport request, the system offers you to write it directly to an available transport.



## Procedure

1.  In the *Business Roles* overview screen of the *Maintain Business Roles* app, select one or more business roles you want to delete.

2.  Click *Delete* and confirm the dialog. A list of available customizing transports appears.

    > ### Note:  
    > The default transport is always displayed as well as your own transports. If no transport exists, a confirmation dialog is shown. If you confirm, a new transport is created.

3.  Select the required transport and click *OK*. The deletion of the selected business roles is then added to the transport and the selected roles will be deleted.

    > ### Note:  
    > Your selection may contain business roles that were not previously deleted. These will be deleted directly without a transport. The system also offers you to delete the business role without transporting the deletion. The role will not be deleted in the target system in this case.

4.  Open the *Export Customizing Transports* app and release your request. For more information, see [Export Customizing Transports](export-customizing-transports-a772a0f.md).

5.  Import your business role to the target system:

    1.  Open the *Manage Software Components* app.

    2.  Select *Business Configuration* in the *Type* dropdown and click *Go*.

    3.  Select the component to which the relevant configuration was exported.

    4.  In the detail view of the component, check out the change that contains your business role\(s\). For more information, see [How to Work with Branches](https://help.sap.com/products/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/6b2f0bfc14cb47ef888f01784c92e1bf.html?version=Cloud).
