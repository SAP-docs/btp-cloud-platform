# Configuration

You can perform remote code analysis in ATC which allows to analyze custom code remotely with the latest checks.

When using SAP BTP ABAP environment as central check system, you will use the `Custom Code Migration` app to scope and analyze custom code in an on-premise SAP system for SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

To use this SAP Fiori app, your SAP administrator must enable the app provide access for the relevant users. In addition, you also need to establish an RFC connection for the Cloud Connector. This enables you to access the on-premise system as checked system from the ABAP environment as central check system remotely.

To find out more about this configuration, see [Configuring Remote ATC Using a Central Check System](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/configuring-remote-atc-using-central-check-system?state=DRAFT&version=Dev).
