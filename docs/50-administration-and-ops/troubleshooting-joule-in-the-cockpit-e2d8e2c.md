# Troubleshooting Joule in the Cockpit

When you work with Joule, you could have questions about the things you see in the chat conversation. A list of common questions and answers are provided here.

> ### Note:  
> Joule general availability is currently being rolled out in stages to global accounts during the second quarter of 2025. If Joule is available for your global account, the Global Account Administrator will first need to enable Joule in the Global Account settings by accepting the legal Terms and Conditions for Generative AI. Only then will the Joule appear in the cockpit tool header.





### I don't see my subaccount in the subaccount list

-   Check to make sure any newly created subaccounts were successfully created. If the create action failed, you'll see a red tag on the subaccount that says *Creation Failed*.





### I'm seeing an error message

-   Try restarting the conversation with Joule by clicking the *New Conversation* button in the Joule menu.
-   Rephrasing your query may help Joule better understand what you want it to do.





### Joule has stopped responding

-   If Joule does not respond to your prompt, try asking again or asking "are you still there?"
-   Try restarting the conversation with Joule by clicking the *New Conversation* button in the Joule menu.





### I'm getting an Identity Provider error message
