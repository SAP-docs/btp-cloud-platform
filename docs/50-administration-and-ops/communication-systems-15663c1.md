# Communication Systems

You can use this app to create communication systems. Communication systems are created to enable the communication among different systems.



With this app you can create new communication systems that you can later use to establish communication arrangements. To enable communication between different systems you have to register these systems in the *Communication Systems* app. The communication system represents the communication partner within a communication. For inbound communication, this is the system that calls services provided by your system. For outbound communication, this is the system that provides services called by your system.
