## Administration of Global Accounts, Directories, and Subaccounts

Some of the typical responsibilities of SAP BTP administrators include maintenance of global accounts, management of directories and subaccounts, and configuration of entitlements. To do this, you can use either the SAP BTP cockpit, the SAP BTP command line interface, or APIs.
