# Maintaining Communication Arrangements

In this topic, a communication arrangement is maintained.



## Prerequisites

The key user must have the business role `SAP_BR_ADMINISTRATOR` \(Administrator\) that contains the business catalog `SAP_CORE_BC_COM` \(Communication Management\).



## Context

After creating a communication arrangement, you can still change parameters, either via a service key or by entering parameters manually. You can change the default values for the Quality of Service \(QoS\), the number of reconnect attempts, the reconnect wait time, and the topic space.



## Procedure

1.  Log on to the SAP Fiori launchpad in the SAP S/4HANA Cloud system.

2.  In the *Communication Management* app, select the *Communication Arrangements* artifact.

3.  Select the communication arrangement you want to maintain.


**Update by Service Key**

4.  To change connection details, press the *Update by Service Key* button.

5.  Enter the service key with the new connection details.

6.  Choose *Update* to save your entries.


**Update Additional Properties**

7.  > ### Note:  
    > Updating via the additional properties reactivates the communication arrangement and channel \(if deactivated\).

    To change additional properties, choose *Edit*.

8.  To save your changes, choose *Save*.




## Results

You have maintained a communication arrangement.
