## Subaccount Capabilities



### I don't see my subaccount in the subaccount list

-   **Cause 1**: In some cases, Joule is limited to displaying the first 15 subaccounts, which are listed alphabetically.
-   **Solution 1**: Type the name of your subaccount directly in the chat window.

-   **Cause 2**: Joule can only list subaccounts that are successfully created in SAP BTP cockpit.
-   **Solution 2**: Check your SAP BTP cockpit global account and make sure that the subaccount was created successfully. If the create action failed, you'll see a red tag on the subaccount that says *Creation Failed*.
