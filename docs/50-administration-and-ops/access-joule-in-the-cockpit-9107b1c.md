# Access Joule in the Cockpit

Launch Joule directly from the SAP BTP cockpit.

> ### Note:  
> Joulegeneral availability is currently being rolled out in stages to global accounts during the second quarter of 2025. If Joule is available for your global account, the Global Account Administrator will first need to enable Joule in the Global Account settings by accepting the legal Terms and Conditions for Generative AI. Only then will the Joule icon appear in the cockpit tool header.

Joule is accessed directly from the cockpit when you click the diamond icon <span class="SAP-icons-V5">îŠ£</span> in the cockpit toolbar. When the chat window opens, you can ask Joule to perform one of the supported capabilities or you can ask Joule a question about SAP BTP.

## Authentication

Joule in the BTP cockpit only supports SAP-managed IAS tenants \(P-/S-users\) for authentication at this time.

## Authorization

Because you're already logged into the SAP BTP cockpit, Joule recognizes you and can perform administrative actions on your behalf. It's important to know that Joule is bound to your cockpit authorization. In other words, Joule can only accomplish tasks for you that you're also authorized to perform.
