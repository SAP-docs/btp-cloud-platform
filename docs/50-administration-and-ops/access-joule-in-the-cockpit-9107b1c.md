# Access Joule in the Cockpit

Launch Joule directly from the SAP BTP cockpit.

Joule is accessed directly from the cockpit when you click the diamond icon <span class="SAP-icons-V5">îŠ£</span> in the cockpit toolbar. When the chat window opens, you can ask Joule to perform one of the supported capabilities or you can ask Joule a question about SAP BTP.

## Authentication

Joule in the BTP cockpit only supports SAP-managed IAS tenants \(P-/S-users\) for authentication at this time. Ensure that you are accessing the cockpit using the SAP default identity provider.

## Authorization

Because you're already logged into the SAP BTP cockpit, Joule recognizes you and can perform administrative actions on your behalf. It's important to know that Joule is bound to your cockpit authorization. In other words, Joule can only accomplish tasks for you that you're also authorized to perform.
