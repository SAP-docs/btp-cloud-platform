## Prerequisites for Using the Audit Log Write API for Customers



### Do the Enablement and Entitlements

As a first step to use the Audit Log Write API, make sure that the service is enabled for your subaccount and that there is an entitlement for **Audit Log service, premium edition** service plan.

If the *Audit Log Service* of plan *premium* is not visible from the account cockpit service marketplace for your subaccount, do the following to entitle the service:

-   To add entitlements on subaccount level, navigate to the subaccount via the account cockpit and choose *Entitlements* \> *Configurate Entitlements*

-   To add entitlements on global account level via the account cockpit, navigate to the account cockpit global account view and choose *Entitlements* \> *Service Assignments*
-   To add entitlements for a global account via the SAP BTP Control Center, choose the global account and go to *Edit* \> *Assign Services*. To select the Auditlog Service checkbox choose *Next* \> *Set Entitlements* \> *Select Auditlog Service* and ensure that there is quota for the “premium” plan of the service in the desired region\(s\).



### Create a Service Instance

The *premium* plan of the auditlog service uses mTLS authentication via X.509 certificates. To create a service instance via the account cockpit, do the following:

1.  Select the *premium* plan for the service instance creation from the Service Marketplace inside the SAP BTP Cockpit.
2.  Choose a runtime and a name for the service instance.
3.  Specify a unique *xsappname* per subaccount for each instance and provide the x509 authentication parameters during service instance creation.

    You can also create a service instance via the CF client with the following sequence of commands:

    ```
    cf api <cf-domain>
    cf login
    cf target -o <desired-org> -s <desired-space>
    cf create-service auditlog premium <my-service-instance> -c '{
      "xs-security": {"xsappname": "<some-unique-name>",
            "oauth2-configuration": {
                "credential-types": ["x509"],
                "grant-types": ["client_credentials"]
        }
      }
    }'
    
    ```


> ### Note:  
> Deleting the service instance doesn't delete the customer audit data already stored in the Audit Log Viewer. For more information, see [Audit Log Retention for the Cloud Foundry Environment](audit-log-retention-for-the-cloud-foundry-environment-adaefa6.md)



### Create a Service Key

The service keys provide credentials and URLs for interacting with your service instance. You can create a service key in one of the following ways: from the account cockpit or via CF command.

-   From your account cockpit, select the created *premium* service instance from the *Instances and Subscriptions* section. Depending on the chosen runtime environment, you can see a *Create* button for either a service key or a service binding. In the service key/binding creation box, specify the validity of the X.509 certificates used for authentication.
-   In the CF client, use the following command. The example parameters sets the certificate credentials validity to 30 days. After that period, the credentials expire and need to be rotated. For more information about the rotation, see the *Credentials rotation* section.

    ```
    cf create-service-key <my-service> <my-key> -c '{
      "xsuaa": {
      "credential-type": "x509",
      "x509": {
        "key-length": 2048,
        "validity": 30,
        "validity-type": "DAYS"
       }
      }
    }'
    
    ```




### Create a Service Binding

Like service keys, the classical service bindings provide credentials and endpoints for using a service instance and are mainly intended to be used with Cloud Foundry applications. You can bind a CF application to one or more service instances. As a result, in the VCAP\_SERVICES application environment variable there is a dedicated JSON object for each service binding.

You can perform the binding operation directly from the account cockpit settings of the application, via the CF client, or via the application deployment manifest. Specifically for the Audit Log Write API “premium” plan, it is important to provide the credentials parameter to enable the provisioning of X.509 certificates. Examples:

-   Create a service binding via the CF client:

    ```
    cf bind-service <sample-application> <auditlog-premium-service-instance> -c '{
      "xsuaa": {
      "credential-type": "x509",
        "x509": {
          "key-length": 2048,
          "validity": 30,
      "validity-type": "DAYS"
        }
      }
    }'
    
    ```

-   Create a service binding through a simple deployment manifest:

    ```
    ---
    applications:
    - name: java-auditlog-sample
      memory: 512M
      instances: 1
      path: target/java-auditlog-sample.war
      env:
        TARGET_RUNTIME: tomcat
      services:
        - name: "<auditlog-premium-service-instance-name>"
          parameters:
            xsuaa:
              credential-type: "x509"
              x509:
                key-length: 2048
                validity: 30
                validity-type: "DAYS"
    
    ```

-   Create a service binding through an MTA deployment manifest:

    ```
    modules:
    - name: <module using the Audit Log Service>
      requires:
        - name: <Audit Log Service Premium Instance Name>
          parameters:
            config:
              xsuaa:
                credential-type: x509
                x509:
                  key-length: 2048
                  validity: 2
                  validity-type: MONTHS
     - name: <other modules>
    
    resources:
    - name: <Audit Log Service Premium Instance Name>
        type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
        parameters:
          service: auditlog
          service-plan: premium
    
    ```




### Obtain Credentials for Authentication and Authorization

This section describes the approach to obtain credentials for authentication and authorization towards the Audit Log Write API.

-   Retrieving service key information

    When you create a service key or binding, do one of the following:

    -   Download the service key data from the account cockpit - select the three dots next to the service key/binding and then *Download*.

    -   Use the following CF command extract the data from the service key:

        ```
        cf service-key <my-service> <my-key>
        ```

        Example of a sample service key or binding object:

        ```
        {
          "uaa": {
            "apiurl": "https://api.authentication.<cf_domain>",
            "certificate": "<x509_certificate>",
            "certificate-pinning": true,
            "certurl": "https://<subdomain>.authentication.cert.<cf_domain>",
            "clientid": "<client_id>",
            "clientx509enabled": true,
            "credential-type": "x509",
            "identityzone": "<identitiy_zone>",
            "identityzoneid": "<identitiy_zone_id>",
            "key": "<private_key>",
            "sburl": "https://internal-xsuaa.authentication.<cf_domain>",
            "subaccountid": "<subaccount_id>",
            "tenantid": "<tenant_id>",
            "tenantmode": "dedicated",
            "uaadomain": "authentication.<cf_domain>",
            "url": "https://<subdomain>.authentication.<cf_domain>",
            "verificationkey": "<verification_key>",
            "xsappname": "<xsappname>",
            "zoneid": "<zone_id>"
          },
          "url": "https://api.auditlog.<cf_domain>:6081",
          "vendor": "SAP"
        }
        
        ```


-   Obtaining credentials for using the Audit Log Write API

    The service key/binding information you retrieve in the previous step, contains the issued client certificates for authentication and the URLs to query the service. You need to use those certificate credentials to issue a JWT token for authentication towards the Write API.

    To prepare a request for issuing a JWT token, extract the PEM certificates and the relevant service data. Extract clientid, certurl, certificate and key from the credentials for the audit log service instance. Save the extracted certificate and key to files in `.pem` format by removing all `\n` entries.

    You can use the following example, considering that the service key/binding information is saved to a json file and use the `cat` and `jq` commands can be used for parsing the file:

    ```
    cat customer-write-api-demo-sk.json | jq --raw-output .uaa.certurl
    
    cat customer-write-api-demo-sk.json | jq --raw-output .uaa.clientid
    
    cat customer-write-api-demo-sk.json | jq --raw-output .url
    
    cat customer-write-api-demo-sk.json | jq --raw-output .uaa.certificate > mtls-certificate.pem
    
    cat customer-write-api-demo-sk.json | jq --raw-output .uaa.key > mtls-private-key.pem
    
    ```

    Then execute a POST request to `<uaa.certurl>oauth/token` using the client certificates. Use the following parameters in the request:

    ```
    URL: <value of "uaa.certurl">/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<value of "uaa.clientid">
    Method: POST
    Authentication Method: Client Certificates
    Certificate: <Value of "uaa.certificate">
    Key: <Value of "uaa.key">
    grant_type: client_credentials
    client_id: <Value of "uaa.clientid">
    
    ```

    Example of such a request using `curl`:

    ```
    curl --cert <path to certificate.pem> --key <path to key.pem> --request POST https://<value of "uaa.certurl">/oauth/token -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<Value of "uaa.clientid">'
    ```

    You can also execute the JWT token request via REST client, like Postman. In such case, make sure to configure the certifciates in the Postman settings as described at [https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/certificates/](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/certificates/).

    Pass the issued JWT token in the Authorization header when calling the Audit Log Server Write REST API: `Authorization: Bearer <token-value>`. Example:

    ```
    curl --location --request POST 'https://api.auditlog.<url-host>:6081/audit-log/oauth2/v2/configuration-changes' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
    --data-raw ‘{message-content}’
    
    ```

    Fore more examples, see section *Example requests for the Audit Log Write API*.

    The JWT token has a limited validity. When the token validity expires, you can issue a new one with the same set of certificate credentials.




### Rotate credentials

Once the validity of the certificate credentials from the service key and service binding expire, the credentials for using the Audit Log service become invalid until the certificates are rotated. Make sure to properly rotate the credentials before they expire to avoid issues using the Audit Log service.

-   For the case of CF apps with service bindings, do the credentials rotation by recreating the service binding with the auditlog service instance \(`cf unbind-service`; `cf bind-service`\). On each bind operation a new set of x509 certificates is generated.

-   For the case of apps using auditlog credentials from an auditlog service key, rotate the credentials by creating a new service key and extracting the certificates and private key from the newly created key.


For security reasons, don't use very long validity period for the mTLS credentials and rotate the certificates as frequently as possible \(depending on the use case and application lifecycle\).
