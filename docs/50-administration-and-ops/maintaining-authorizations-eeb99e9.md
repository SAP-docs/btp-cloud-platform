<a name="loioeeb99e99924242529b9624c6478a5055__MaintainingAuthorizations_context"/>

## Context

In order to grant access and authorizations to the *Application Job Templates* app, create a new business role assigning the business catalog `SAP_CORE_BC_APJ_TPL` to it.



<a name="loioeeb99e99924242529b9624c6478a5055__MaintainingAuthorizations_steps"/>

## Procedure

1.  Create a new business role assigning the business catalog `SAP_CORE_BC_APJ_TPL` to it. For more information, see *Maintain Business Roles* linked below.

2.  **\(Optional\)** If you want to grant read or write access to templates of other users, select *Maintain Restrictions* to provide *Write*, *Read*, or *No Access* using the restriction type `APPLICATION JOB TEMPLATE LAYER`.

3.  Go back to *Save* your template.

    > ### Note:  
    > You will always be able to see your own templates and the templates delivered by your software provider without having to maintain further authorizations.

    > ### Note:  
    > The possible values for the layer field are *Global*, *Shared*, and *Private*. These are described in *Application Job Templates* linked below. The restriction type *Global* is predelivered by SAP and therefore can't be edited or deleted, but you can modify the restriction types *Shared* and *Private* to your needs.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you want to schedule multistep templates with the *Application Jobs* app, you'll need the appropriate authorizations for all steps.
