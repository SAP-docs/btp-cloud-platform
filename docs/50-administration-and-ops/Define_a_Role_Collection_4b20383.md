# Define a Role Collection

To define a role collection, you can create a new role collection or copy an existing one. Add the roles, users, and user groups as needed.



## Context

One way to define a role collection is to create a new role collection. After you've entered a name and description, you find the new role collection in the list of role collections. You can then add the roles you need and assign users and user groups.

If you have an existing role collection that you want to use as a template, it's a good idea to copy it. The copied role collection includes all of the roles of the origin. However, it doesn't include the users or user groups. You can give it a new name and description. You can find the copy in the list of role collections and assign users and user groups.



## Procedure

1.  Open the SAP BTP cockpit.

2.  Go to your global account and subaccount \(see [Navigate in the Cockpit](Navigate_in_the_Cockpit_0874895.md)\).

3.  Choose *Security* \> *Role Collections*.

4.  To create a new role collection, choose <span class="SAP-icons"></span> \(Create New Role Collection\). To copy an existing role collection, choose *Copy* at the end of the row.

5.  Enter a new name and description. If you copied an existing role collection, you can see the included roles.

6.  Save your changes.

    You can now add or remove roles and assign users or user groups.
