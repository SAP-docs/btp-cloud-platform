## Context

If you run SAP BTP ABAP environment as part of a hybrid landscape with on-premise and cloud systems, you might already have a central monitoring and alerting infrastructure in place. For example, the service offering SAP Focused Run is designed specifically for businesses that need high-volume system and application monitoring, alerting, and analytics, especially for hybrid landscapes including on-premise SAP solutions.

In addition, for cloud-centric customers, there's SAP Cloud ALM as an application lifecycle management offering.

If you use SAP Focused Run or SAP Cloud ALM as monitoring and alerting infrastructure, you can integrate monitoring of the ABAP environment into your existing infrastructure. Using the health monitoring in SAP Focused Run or SAP Cloud ALM, you can watch whether your ABAP environment is still up and running and whether any exceptional situations occurred. In addition, you can use the real-user monitoring to monitor requests coming from business users and integration monitoring to watch the communication between integrated systems.
