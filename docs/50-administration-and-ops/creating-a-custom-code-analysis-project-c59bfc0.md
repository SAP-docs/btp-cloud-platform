# Creating a Custom Code Analysis Project

With a custom code analysis project, you can analyze custom code with arbitrary ATC check variants.



## Procedure

1.  Start the tile *Custom Code Migration* from the SAP Fiori launchpad.

2.  Choose *Create*, then choose *Custom Code Analysis Project*.

3.  Fill in the fields under *Project Data* for your new project.

    1.  *Project Description*: Provide further details about your custom code migration project.

    2.  *Check Variant*: Use the value help to select a check variant available in your system.

    3.  *Location of Custom Code*: Use the dropdown menu to specify the system in which the custom code to be analyzed is located.

    4.  *Object Provider to Remote System*: An object provider defines the RFC connection to be used for analysis in a remote SAP system and must be assigned to a system group.



> ### Note:  
> If you collected usage data, choose the *Add* button to add usage data to your custom code migration project.
> 
> Under *Advanced Configuration*, you can limit your custom code analysis by specifying the packages you want to analyze. This can be helpful to save time and resources.
> 
> These steps are optional.

4.  In the *Advanced Configuration* tab, under *Analysis Configuration*, you can either leave the check box checked and start the custom code analysis automatically at project creation or uncheck it and start the analysis manually at a later point.

5.  To confirm your input, choose *Create*.
