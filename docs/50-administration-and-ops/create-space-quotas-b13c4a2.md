## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the subaccount that contains the spaces to which you want to add quotas.

2.  In the navigation menu, choose *Cloud Foundry* \> *Space Quotas*.

3.  Choose *Create Space Quota*.

4.  Enter a name for your space quota and add limits for the following:

    -   *Space Memory \(MB\)*: Total amount of memory a space can have

    -   *Routes*: Total number of routes

    -   *Service Instances*: Total number of service instances

    -   *Memory per Instance \(MB\)*: Maximum amount of memory an application instance can have

    -   *App Instances*: Total number of application instances

    -   \(Optional\) *Allow Paid Service*: Switch on if you'd like to allow the provisioning of instances of paid service plans.

    > ### Note:  
    > The value of `-1` represents an unlimited amount.

    > ### Note:  
    > If the space quota limit for a resource exceeds the org quota limit, the org quota limit applies.

5.  Choose *Create*.
