# How To View and Manage Changed IAM Apps After an Upgrade

Learn how to review IAM app changes after an upgrade. This includes added or removed IAM apps, updates to access categories and restriction types, dependency changes, and deprecations with successor IAM apps. Use the dedicated tabs to analyze impacted business catalogs and business roles. You can export change lists in CSV format to assess the impact and take corrective action.
