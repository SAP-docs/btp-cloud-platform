## Context

Due to ongoing development of new features and new apps, we need to periodically revise existing business catalogs. This means that some business catalogs are deprecated and replaced by new ones, and you need to assign business roles and business users to these new catalogs.

Rather than disappearing, deprecated business catalogs are identified as being obsolete, which allows you to identify them at a glance. You can also check how many deprecated business catalogs you still have in use with the *Business Catalogs* app. This app lets you change assignments from the old, deprecated business catalogs to the new, active catalogs quickly and easily.

> ### Note:  
> Some business catalogs might be redesigned in each release. Please check the assignments for your business roles and business users and make the necessary changes to the assignments as soon as possible.

## Procedure

1.  In the *Business Catalogs* app, check how many deprecated business catalogs you still have in use.

    You can filter the list of catalogs for the deprecated ones but the deprecated business catalogs are also marked with the appendix \(deprecated\) in the list of all catalogs in use.

2.  Change assignments from the old, deprecated business catalogs to the new, active catalogs.

    Once the deprecation of a business catalog is announced via the *Business Catalogs* app, the catalog will remain in the system for six months before being deleted. During this period you can use the old or the new business catalog. Within this timeframe you can do the replacement when it suits you best. In the *Business Catalogs* app, you can see the release in which the deprecation of a business catalog was announced.

    **Example:** A business catalog is deprecated with a Cloud 2202 release. The business catalog will then be deleted with the Cloud 2208 release.

3.  Ensure that also the assignments of custom catalog extensions are changed.
