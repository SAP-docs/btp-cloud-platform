With this app you can display details of deleted business users, such as the retention period, and allow or block their re-creation.

## Key Features

You can use this app to:



-   Display a list of all deleted users including deletion time, end of re-creation period and re-creation status

-   Resolve the identity of deleted business users by displaying contact details such as email address or phone number
-   Change the re-creation status from *Allowed*to *Not Allowed*or the other way round.
