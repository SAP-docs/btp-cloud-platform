# Effects on the Maintain Business Roles App

Learn which information about IAM apps of the app authorization variant type you can view and manage in the *Maintain Business Roles* app.



IAM apps can either be assigned directly to a business role or through a business catalog that bundles several IAM apps. Some business catalogs might not yet support IAM apps. To check if a business catalog supports IAM apps, open the *Business Catalogs* app and use the *Supports IAM Apps* filter. To view the IAM apps assigned to a business role, select a business role and go to the *IAM Apps* tab. On this tab, you can activate or deactivate the assigned IAM app for this business role.

To view the history of changes to a business role regarding the IAM apps assigned, select a business role and choose *Display Changes*. On the *Change Documents* screen, select *Assigned IAM Apps* for the *Change Category* filter and choose *Go*.

To activate or deactivate IAM apps for more than one business role at once, select the relevant business roles, choose *Mass Change* and use the *Mass Change Wizard*.

If the business role is created from a business role template, the *Activate IAM Apps* checkbox is selected on the *Create Business Role from Template* screen.
