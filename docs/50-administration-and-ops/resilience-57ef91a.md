# Resilience

The resilience of your ABAP Cloud applications and your data provided by a set of SAP BTP ABAP environment features.

SAP BTP ABAP environment provides the following set of features to increase the availability and resilience of your ABAP cloud applications and your data:

-   Both the infrastructures for ABAP systems and SAP HANA Cloud databases are set up across multiple availability zones.

-   The infrastructures offer automatic restarts for critical components of the Application Server for ABAP, the HANA Cloud database, and connectivity components.

-   In case of hardware failures, components are automatically rescheduled to other hardware \(subject to availability\).

-   Enqueue locks are stored redundantly.


> ### Note:  
> SAP BTP ABAP environment provides protection against denial-of-service attacks via various defense mechanisms. These are continuously improved to keep a decent protection level. However, a full protection against DoS attacks cannot be guaranteed.
