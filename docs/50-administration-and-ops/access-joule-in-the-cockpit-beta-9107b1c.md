Joule is accessed directly from the cockpit when you click the diamond icon <span class="SAP-icons-V5">îŠ£</span> in the cockpit tool header. When the chat window opens, you can ask Joule to perform one of the supported capabilities or you can ask Joule a question about SAP BTP.

## Authentication

Joule currently only supports SAP ID service, the default identity provider of SAP BTP. To learn more about SAP ID service, see [Default Identify Provider](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/d6a8db70bdde459f92f2837349f95090.html?locale=en-US&state=PRODUCTION&version=Cloud).

## Authorization

Because you're already logged into the SAP BTP cockpit, Joule recognizes you and can perform administrative actions on your behalf. It's important to know that Joule is bound to your cockpit authorization. In other words, Joule can only accomplish tasks for you that you're authorized to perform.
