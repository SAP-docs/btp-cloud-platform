# Supported Administrative Tasks with Joule in the Cockpit

Learn about the administrative tasks that Joule can perform for you in the SAP BTP cockpit.

> ### Note:  
> Joulegeneral availability is currently being rolled out in stages to global accounts during the second quarter of 2025. If Joule is available for your global account, the Global Account Administrator will first need to enable Joule in the Global Account settings by accepting the legal Terms and Conditions for Generative AI. Only then will the Joule icon appear in the cockpit tool header.

You can ask Joule to assist you with administrative scenarios related to accounts and users. If Joule recognizes the task as a supported capability, it walks you through the steps to complete the task.

> ### Note:  
> Joule doesn't support administrative actions in the Neo environment.

You can ask Joule what it can do for you, either by typing the question directly or selecting the quick start button.
