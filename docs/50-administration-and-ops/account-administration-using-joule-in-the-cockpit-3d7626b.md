# Account Administration Using Joule in the Cockpit

Learn about the administrative tasks that SAP's generative AI copilot, Joule, can assist you with SAP BTP cockpit.

> ### Note:  
> A Global Account Administrator must enable Joule in the Global Account settings by accepting the legal Terms and Conditions for Generative AI. Only then will the Joule icon appear in the cockpit tool header. Check out [Enable Joule in the Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/enable-joule-in-sap-btp-cockpit?version=Cloud) to learn more.

Joule makes it easy to quickly access information about your accounts and users in the cockpit.

-   Ask Joule to perform an administrative action for you from a set of pre-defined capabilities.
-   Ask Joule a question about SAP BTP services or the cockpit. Joule references SAP BTP documentation and provides a summary of what it finds, as well as links to relevant help content.
