# Audit Log Retrieval API Usage for Subaccounts in the Cloud Foundry Environment

The audit log retrieval API allows you to retrieve the audit logs for your SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment subaccount.

> ### Note:  
> After the audit logs are generated and sent to the Audit Log service, the logs are not immediately accessible for retrieval.Retrieving of audit logs via the Audit Log Retrieval API is limited to the size of the audit logs generated for the subaccount. The audit log results are provided as a collection of JSON entities. The possible request rate is now limited to:

-   4 requests per second per auth-token/tenant on CF-EU11, CF-EU30, CF-US20, CF-US21, CF-JP10, CF-JP20, CF-BR10. There is also a burst queue that can temporarily allow up to 20 requests per second.

-   8 requests per second per auth-token/tenant on CF-EU10, CF-EU20, CF-US10, CF-US30. There is also a burst queue that can temporarily allow up to 40 requests per second.

The API returns a HTTP 429 response code when the limits are exceeded.

The audit log retrieval API is protected by OAuth. To consume the audit log retrieval API, you need your system to generate and use a valid OAuth.

## Prerequisites

To execute the procedure, you need to have the `Space Developer` role for the corresponding Space.

> ### Note:  
> For security reasons, we recommend you to re-create the `auditlog-management` Service-Instance bindings and service keys at least every 90 days.

## Create Instance of the `auditlog-management` Service

1.  Create a Cloud Foundry Org and Space, in case you don't have any. See [Create Spaces](create-spaces-2f6ed22.md).

2.  Log in the Cloud Foundry landscape using the corresponding Cloud Foundry API \(Infrastructure/Landscape Overview\).

    ```
    cf login -a <API_URL> -o <ORG> -s <SPACE> -u <USER>
    ```

3.  Create a service instance of the service `auditlog-management`.

    > ### Note:  
    > For security reasons, we strongly recommend you to adopt the provided mutual TLS authentication \(mTLS\). The mTLS authentication relies on X.509 certificates for the verification of the parties in the network connection. Create the `auditlog-managenment` service instances with the additional parameters, as explained in the following mTLS points.

    -   \(Recommended\) For mTLS authentication using X.509 certificates, use:

        ```
        cf create-service auditlog-management default <SERVICE_INSTANCE> -c '{
            "xs-security": {
                "xsappname": "auditlog",
                "oauth2-configuration": {
                    "credential-types": [
                        "x509"
                    ],
                    "grant-types": [
                        "client_credentials"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }'
        ```

        > ### Note:  
        > The `xsappname` attribute from the service parameters JSON needs to have unique instance for each service. The `xsappname` attribute can hold an arbitrary string as value, which is not required to be `auditlog`. The code block serves only as example.

    -   For non-mTLS authentication, use


        `cf create-service auditlog-management default <SERVICE_INSTANCE>`

        > ### Note:  
        > If there's a previously created auditlog-management service instance without the security parameters for mTLS, we recommend you to delete that instance and create a new instance with mTLS authentication using the parameters from the previous \(recommended\) scenario.

4.  Create a key for the service instance:

    -   For service instances with mTLS, use:

        ```
        cf create-service-key <SERVICE_INSTANCE> <SERVICE_KEY> -c '{
            "xsuaa": {
                "credential-type": "x509",
                "x509": {
                    "key-length": 2048,
                    "validity": 1,
                    "validity-type": "DAYS"
                }
            }
        }'
        ```

        > ### Note:  
        > You can specify the validity period of the service key for each use case. To use the service instance, once the key validity expires, create a new key. By default and for security reasons, the key from this code example is created with a validity of 1 day.

    -   For service instances without mTLS, use:

        `cf create-service-key <SERVICE_INSTANCE> <SERVICE_KEY>`

5.  List the key of the service instance:

    `cf service-key <SERVICE_INSTANCE> <SERVICE_KEY>`

6.  Extract data from the service key.
    -   For mTLS scenario:

        -   Extract the values for `uaa.clientid` and `uaa.certurl` of the key of the service instance for access token creation.
        -   Extract the value for `url` and use it for later request to retrieve audit logs.
        -   Extract the value for `uaa.certificate`, remove all `\n` entries from the X.509 certificate, and save it as a file in the `.pem` format.
        -   Extract the value for `uaa.key`, remove all `\n` entries from the RSA private key, and save it as a file in the `.pem` format.

        > ### Note:  
        > To extract of the values and avoid errors while copying or removing characters, you can use the `sed` and `jq` tools:
        > 
        > ```
        > cf service-key <SERVICE_INSTANCE> <SERVICE_KEY> | sed '/Getting key/d' | jq --raw-output .credentials.uaa.certurl
        > cf service-key <SERVICE_INSTANCE> <SERVICE_KEY> | sed '/Getting key/d' | jq --raw-output .credentials.uaa.clientid
        > cf service-key <SERVICE_INSTANCE> <SERVICE_KEY> | sed '/Getting key/d' | jq --raw-output .credentials.url
        > # the following two commands save the output to .pem files on the location, where the command is executed
        > cf service-key <SERVICE_INSTANCE> <SERVICE_KEY> | sed '/Getting key/d' | jq --raw-output .credentials.uaa.certificate > mtls-certificate.pem
        > cf service-key <SERVICE_INSTANCE> <SERVICE_KEY> | sed '/Getting key/d' | jq --raw-output .credentials.uaa.key > mtls-private-key.pem
        > ```

    -   For non-mTLS scenario:

        Extract values for `uaa.url`, `uaa.clientid` and `uaa.clientsecret` of the key of the service instance for access token creation. Extract the `url` to be used for later request to retrieve audit logs.

## Create an OAuth Access Token

1.  Request an OAuth access token

    -   For mTLS scenario

        To request the OAuth access token via the mTLS extracted X.509 certificates and RSA private key flow, execute an HTTP POST request with the following parameters:

        ```
        URL: <value of "uaa.certurl">/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<value of "uaa.clientid">
        Method: POST
        Authentication Method: Client Certificates
        Certificate: <Value of "uaa.certificate">
        Key: <Value of "uaa.key">
        grant_type: client_credentials
        client_id: <Value of "uaa.clientid">
        ```

        Example:

        ```
        curl --cert <path to certificate.pem> --key <path to key.pem> --request POST https://<value of "uaa.certurl">/oauth/token -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<Value of "uaa.clientid">'
        ```

    -   For non-mTLS scenario

    Request the OAuth access token via the OAuth client credentials flow, by executing an HTTP POST request with the following parameters:

    ```
    URL: <value of "uaa.url">/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials
    Method: POST
    Authentication Method: Basic Authentication
    Username: <Value of "uaa.clientid">
    Password: <Value of "uaa.clientsecret">
    
    ```

2.  Extract the value of the `access_token` attribute from the JSON response.

    This token grants access to the audit logs of the subaccount on the landscape where the service instance is created.

    > ### Note:  
    > The token is valid for 1 hour.

    > ### Note:  
    > This token grants access to the audit logs of the subaccount on the landscapeThe content of the access token can be displayed using a standard JWT decoder

## Audit Log Retrieval

The Audit Log Retrieval API incorporates server-side paging to address the efficient handling of queries producing substantial result sets.

> ### Note:  
> The logs are not immediately accessible for retrieval

In instances where the query produces a result with significant size, the API systematically partitions the output into manageable chunks. The response includes an HTTP header featuring a handle, designed to facilitate the retrieval of subsequent result segments. To obtain additional portions of the result, pass the handle as a URL parameter in the subsequent retrieval request. The size of each chunk is predetermined, with a page size fixed at 500.

Supported request parameters:

-   `time_from and time_to`â€“ if no time filter is specified the default timeframe of 30 days back is returned. Use the following format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS, for example 2018-05-11T10:42:00. The time is in UTC.

-   `handle` - in case the result set is too large, it's chunked, and a handle is returned for reading the next chunk. The handle is returned as a Response Header in the form: Paging: `handle=<value>`. Then you can provide `handle=<value>` as a request parameter in the subsequent retrieval request.

-   `category` - this parameter allows you to filter the audit logs by predefined event types. If no event type is specified, all event types are returned. The available event types are:

    -   `audit.security-events`

    -   `audit.configuration`
    -   `audit.data-access`
    -   `audit.data-modification`

    To filter by a specific event type, provide the event type name as the value for this parameter, for example `category=audit.data-access`. Multiple event types can be specified separated by commas, for example `category=audit.data-access,audit.configuration`.

    > ### Note:  
    > Filterning by category doesn't work for custom retention periods and Sovereign cloud. In such case, an error code 501 is returned with the following format and message:
    > 
    > ```
    > {
    >   "error": {
    >     "code": "filter_category_not_supported",
    >     "message": "Filtering by category not available for custom retention periods. Remove categories to proceed."
    >   }
    > }
    > ```




### Example: Get audit logs for the last 30 days

Execute the following HTTP GET request:

```
<url_from_service_key>/auditlog/v2/auditlogrecords
```

Provide the OAuth access token as an `"Authorization"` header: `"Authorization: Bearer <access_token>"` 

The response is in JSON format, containing the audit log entries, split on pages if needed.



### Example: Get audit logs filtering by time

Execute the following HTTP GET request:

```
<url_from_service_key>/auditlog/v2/auditlogrecords?time_from=2018-05-10T10:42:00&time_to=2018-05-11T10:46:00
```



### Example: Get audit logs filtered by event type

You can query for one of the predefined audit log event types for the `category` parameter.

Execute the following HTTP GET request:

```
<url_from_service_key>/auditlog/v2/auditlogrecords?time_from=2018-05-10T10:42:00&time_to=2018-05-11T10:46:00&category=audit.data-access
```



### Example: Get audit logs next chunk determined by the server-side paging

Execute the following HTTP GET request:

```
<url_from_service_key>/auditlog/v2/auditlogrecords?handle=2018-06-14T10:11:18.968<4f932695-8616-4e1f-ac9a-1cdfb758f01d<2018-06-14T10:11:00.000
```

Response codes:

`HTTP Codes`

`HTTP 200 OK`

`HTTP 204 NO_CONTENT`

`HTTP 401 UNAUTHORIZED`

`HTTP 400 BAD_REQUEST`

`HTTP 403 FORBIDDEN`

`HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`

`HTTP 501 NOT_IMPLEMENTED`
