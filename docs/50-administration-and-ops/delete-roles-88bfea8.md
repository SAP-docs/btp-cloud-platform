# Delete Roles

Use the SAP BTP cockpit to delete a role. If this role has been added to a role collection, it's also deleted from the role collection.

## Context

You can use existing role templates to create new roles. An SAP BTP cockpit wizard helps you to configure new roles.

> ### Note:  
> You cannot delete roles that belong to default role collections delivered by SAP BTP.

## Procedure

3.  Choose *Security* in the navigation pane.

4.  Choose *Roles*.

    Here you see a complete list of all existing roles sorted by application name. It also contains the role template, role names, and role description. On the right side, you find the action buttons.
