# SAP Support User Request Log

The *SAP Support User Request Log* is part of the *Display Technical Users* app.



SAP personnel need access to customer systems for support and operations. Customers require details about this access for audits and the fiscal year-end closing process. In the *Display Technical Users* app, you can display more information about when and why SAP support users accessed your customer system in the past 12 months. For each support user, the relevant incident ID, access level, access category, customer user, request date and validity date is displayed when you choose the desired entry in the *Users* list. SAP support user IDs are pseudonymized to respect the data subject rights of SAP employees according to GDPR.

> ### Note:  
> The SAP Support User Request Log is also evaluable with the CDS view entity `I_IAMSupportUserRequestLog`.
