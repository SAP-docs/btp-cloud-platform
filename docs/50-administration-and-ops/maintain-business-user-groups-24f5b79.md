# Maintain Business User Groups



With this app you can create business user groups and assign multiple business users to them. This helps you to organize your area and easily search for all business users of a certain category \(for example to assign them to business roles\). Grouping also facilitates maintenance of authorizations. If you are the super administrator for all areas, you can delegate this task to administrators for the relevant areas, such as Financials. In this case, you would create a business user group for Financials.

Please note that the name of business user group is created automatically in namespace *ZCB*.



## Key Features

You can use this app to:



-   Create business user groups and assign the required business users to them

-   Reassign/remove business users to/from business user groups

    Note: You can also use drag and drop to move business users from one group to another.

-   Upload business user assignments

-   Add business user groups to transports

-   Export business user groups to a spreadsheet \(including description and number of business users\)
