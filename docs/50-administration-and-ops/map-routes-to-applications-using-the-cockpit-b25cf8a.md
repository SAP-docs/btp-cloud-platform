# Map Routes to Applications Using the Cockpit

Once a route has been created, you can map it to an application to make this application reachable for end users.



<a name="loiob25cf8a1eeeb4d7d85a009027aad66c1__prereq_lpw_gfq_43b"/>

## Prerequisites

You have at least one route and one deployed application in the same Cloud Foundry space.



## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the *Routes* page in your Cloud Foundry space.

2.  For the route that you wish to map to an application, choose :link: \(Map Route\) from the *Actions* column and select the application you want to map it to.




<a name="loiob25cf8a1eeeb4d7d85a009027aad66c1__result_ugl_qlq_43b"/>

## Results

Your application can now be accessed via the route mapped to it. You can launch your mapped route from 2 different places in the cockpit:

-   *Routes* page:

    Choose <span class="SAP-icons"></span> \(Launch Route\) from the *Actions* column.

-   *Overview* page of the mapped applcation:

    Choose the URL from the *Application Routes* section.
