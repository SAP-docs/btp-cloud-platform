# Map Role Collections to User Groups

You want to assign a role collection to a user group provided by an identity provider that has a custom trust configuration in SAP BTP. In this case, the assignment is a mapping of a user group to a role collection. Your identity provider provides the user groups using the attribute called `Groups`. Each value of the attribute is mapped to a role collection as described in this procedure.

## Prerequisites

-   You've configured your custom identity provider and established trust with your subaccount.

    > ### Remember:  
    > The name of the trust configuration is different from SAP ID service. The name of a custom trust configuration to SAP Cloud Identity Services could be as follows:
    > 
    > <code>https://<i class="varname">&lt;tenant_id&gt;</i>.accounts.ondemand.com</code>

-   You've configured the identity provider so that it conveys the user's group memberships in the *groups* attribute.

    -   For business users, see [Map User Attributes from a Corporate Identity Provider for Business Users](map-user-attributes-from-a-corporate-identity-provider-for-business-users-bbb4a8a.md).

    -   For platform users, see [Map User Attributes from a Corporate Identity Provider for Platform Users](map-user-attributes-from-a-corporate-identity-provider-for-platform-users-40c2e54.md).


-   You've created role collections.




## Context

The identity provider provides the users, who can belong to user groups. Itâ€™s efficient to map user groups to role collections. The role collection as a reusable element contains the authorizations that are necessary for this user group. Mappings save time when you want to add a new user. Simply add the user to the respective user group or groups, and the user automatically gets all the authorizations that are included in the role collections.



## Procedure

To map a user group to a role collection, see [Assign User Groups to Role Collections](assign-user-groups-to-role-collections-9562d9d.md).

You can also map role collections to attributes other than groups. For more information, see the related links.
