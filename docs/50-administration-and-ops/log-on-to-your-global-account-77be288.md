# Log On to Your Global Account

Use the SAP BTP cockpit to log on to your global account and start working in SAP BTP.



<a name="loio77be28886328492086ab07c003cb8d37__prereq_mkv_1m3_mdb"/>

## Prerequisites

You have received a welcome e-mail from SAP for your global account.



## Context

> ### Note:  
> The content in this section is only relevant for cloud management tools feature set A. For more information, see [Cloud Management Tools - Feature Set Overview](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/caf4e4e23aef4666ad8f125af393dfb2.html).

When your organization signs a contract for SAP BTP services, an e-mail is sent to the e-mail address specified in the contract. The e-mail message contains the link to log on to the system and the SAP Cloud Identity credentials \(user ID\) for the specified user. These credentials can also be used for sites such as the [SAP Store](https://www.sapstore.com/) or the [SAP Community](https://www.sap.com/community.html).
