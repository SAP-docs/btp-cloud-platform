## Procedure

1.  Select the tile of the *Maintain Business Roles* app on the SAP Fiori Launchpad to open the app.

2.  On the initial screen, open the business role you need to edit by clicking on it in the *Business Roles* list. Alternatively, you can either use the *Search* or filter for the business role ID, for example.

3.  To enter the edit mode, click *Edit*.

    A draft version of the business role is created in which the editing takes place. The active business role remains.

4.  Make the required changes to the business role.

5.  Save the business role.

    Once the changes are saved, they are written into the active business role and the draft version disappears. **If the dialog for editing a business role is left without saving the business role**, the active business role as well as the draft version of the business role will be available in the business roles overview. In this case, you can continue editing the draft version later.
