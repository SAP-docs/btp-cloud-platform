# Audit Log Retention for the Cloud Foundry Environment

The audit log data is stored on a subaccount level. The access to the stored audit log data is strictly restricted - only authorized stakeholders can preview, retrieve, and download their audit log data.

Currently, there are two main categories of retention of audit data, divided by the source of generation:

-   [Retention of Audit Data written from SAP BTP Applications and Services](retention-of-audit-data-written-from-sap-btp-applications-and-services-3ea497f.md) \(SAP-generated\)

-   [Retention of Audit Data written from Customer’s BTP Applications](retention-of-audit-data-written-from-customer-s-btp-applications-9cf4217.md) \(Customer-generated\)
