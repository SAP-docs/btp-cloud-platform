# Troubleshooting

You can use the [Guided Answers for Audit Logging in the Cloud Foundry Environment](https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/#/tree/3642/actions/59095) page as self service to troubleshoot your issues.

If you don't manage to solve your issue with the Guided Answers, you can open a support ticket in [SAP4Me](https://me.sap.com/servicessupport), in which you need to provide:

-   Your GA ID

-   Your subaccount ID

-   Step by step description of the issue with screenshots.
