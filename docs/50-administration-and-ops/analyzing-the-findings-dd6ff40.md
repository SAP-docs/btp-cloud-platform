# Analyzing the Findings

When you create a custom code analysis project, the custom code analysis is performed automatically. The Analyze Custom Code app then provides you with an analytical representation of the findings.

## Procedure

1.  Choose *Analysis* to get an overview of the results, as soon as the first analysis has been finished.

2.  Choose *Analyze Findings* to get a detailed analysis.

3.  In the *Analyze Custom Code - Analysis - Findings* view, you can specify various filters, such as:

    -   *Quick Fix Availability*: Analyze which findings can be solved by a Quick Fix and which findings have to be solved manually.

        *Scope Information*: Filter the results to only show findings for objects that are in scope.


4.  Choose :gear: in the *Findings* section to change the settings for the chart.

    For example, to show the Quick Fix availability per Check Message, you need to specify the following settings for the chart in the *Chart* tab under *Dimensions*:

    -   Check Title \(as Category\)

    -   Check Message \(as Category\)

    -   Quick Fix Availability \(as Series\)
