# Partition HANA Tables



With this app you can break down large columnar tables into partitions. By default, database tables on SAP HANA are not partitioned. The SAP HANA database allows for a maximum number of approximately two billion records per table. If this threshold is exceeded, your application stops working. To avoid this, you need to partition your tables in time.



## Key Features

This app provides the following key features:



-   Search for large tables that can be partitioned according to certain filter criteria

-   Partition large tables

-   Undo the partitioning of a table by merging the partitions of a table back into one table


> ### Note:  
> With this app you can only partition your own tables or tables that have explicitly been classified for partitioning by SAP.
