# Integrating ABAP Test Cockpit Checked Systems

Learn how to integrate ABAP Test Cockpit \(ATC\) checked systems and how to enable the Code Explain functionality in the Analyze Custom Code/Custom Code Migration app.

**SAP\_COM\_0464:** This communication scenario connects the Analyze Custom Code/Custom Code Migration app running in an SAP BTP ABAP environment, with the customer's SAP S/4HANA or SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition ABAP system. Via this Remotr Function Call \(RFC\) connectivity, the Analyze Custom Code/Custom Code Migration app analyzes the custom code in the connected system using the ABAP Test Cockpit \(ATC\). One ABAP tenant can be connected to multiple such ABAP systems, but only one connection can be made to the same ABAP system.

**SAP\_COM\_0B22:** This communication arrangement describes the configuration steps that have to be carried out to enable the Code Explain functionality in the Analyze Custom Code/Custom Code Migration app on the SAP Fiori launchpad.
